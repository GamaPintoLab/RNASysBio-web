abstract: Â© 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry In this review, we present
  our most recent understanding of key biomolecular processes that underlie two motor
  neuron degenerative disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular
  atrophy. We focus on the role of four multifunctional proteins involved in RNA metabolism
  (TDP-43, FUS, SMN, and Senataxin) that play a causal role in these diseases. Recent
  results have led to a novel scenario of intricate connections between these four
  proteins, bringing transcriptome homeostasis into the spotlight as a common theme
  in motor neuron degeneration. We review reported functional and physical interactions
  between these four proteins, highlighting their common association with nuclear
  bodies and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle biogenesis and function. We
  discuss how these interactions are turning out to be particularly relevant for the
  control of transcription and chromatin homeostasis, including the recent identification
  of an association between SMN and Senataxin required to ensure the resolution of
  DNA-RNA hybrid formation and proper termination by RNA polymerase II. These connections
  strongly support the existence of common pathways underlying the spinal muscular
  atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotype. We also discuss the potential
  of genome-wide expression profiling, in particular RNA sequencing derived data,
  to contribute to unravelling the underlying mechanisms. We provide a review of publicly
  available datasets that have addressed both diseases using these approaches, and
  highlight the value of investing in cross-disease studies to promote our understanding
  of the pathways leading to neurodegeneration. (Figure presented.).
