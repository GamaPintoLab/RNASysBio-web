  mutation is F508del, which causes not only intracellular retention and degradation
  of CFTR, but also defective channel gating and decreased membrane stability of the
  small amount that reaches the plasma membrane (PM). Thus, pharmacological correction
  of mutant CFTR requires targeting of multiple cellular defects in order to achieve
  clinical benefit. Although small-molecule compounds have been identified and commercialized
  that can correct its folding or gating, an efficient retention of F508del CFTR at
  the PM has not yet been explored pharmacologically despite being recognized as a
  crucial factor for improving functional rescue of chloride transport. In ongoing
  efforts to determine the CFTR interactome at the PM, we used three complementary
  approaches: targeting proteins binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated CFTR, protein
  complexes involved in cAMP-mediated CFTR stabilization at the PM, and proteins selectively
  interacting at the PM with rescued F508del-CFTR but not wt-CFTR. Using co-immunoprecipitation
  or peptide–pull down strategies, we identified around 400 candidate proteins through
  sequencing of complex protein mixtures using the nano-LC Triple TOF MS technique.
  Key candidate proteins were validated for their robust interaction with CFTR-containing
  protein complexes and for their ability to modulate the amount of CFTR expressed
  at the cell surface of bronchial epithelial cells. Here, we describe how we explored
  the abovementioned experimental datasets to build a protein interaction network
  with the aim of identifying novel pharmacological targets to rescue CFTR function
  in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We identified and validated novel candidate proteins
  that were essential components of the network but not detected in previous proteomic
  analyses.'
