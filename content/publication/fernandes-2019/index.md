abstract: © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)
  is a well characterized eukaryotic mRNA degradation pathway, responsible for the
  identification and degradation of transcripts harboring translation termination
  codons in premature contexts. Transcriptome-wide studies revealed that NMD is not
  only an mRNA surveillance pathway as initially thought, but is also a post-transcriptional
  regulatory mechanism of gene expression, as it fine-tunes the transcript levels
  of many wild-type genes. Hence, NMD contributes to the regulation of many essential
  biological processes, including pathophysiological mechanisms. In this chapter we
  discuss the importance of NMD and of its regulation to organism development and
  its link to the cellular stress responses, like the unfolded protein response (UPR)
  and the integrated stress response (ISR). Additionally, we describe how tumor cells
  have explored both NMD functions to promote tumorigenesis. Using published data
  and databases, we have also performed a network-based approach that further supports
  the link between NMD and these (patho) physiological processes.
