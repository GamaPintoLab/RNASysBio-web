 abstract = {© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a well characterized eukaryotic mRNA degradation pathway, responsible for the identification and degradation of transcripts harboring translation termination codons in premature contexts. Transcriptome-wide studies revealed that NMD is not only an mRNA surveillance pathway as initially thought, but is also a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of gene expression, as it fine-tunes the transcript levels of many wild-type genes. Hence, NMD contributes to the regulation of many essential biological processes, including pathophysiological mechanisms. In this chapter we discuss the importance of NMD and of its regulation to organism development and its link to the cellular stress responses, like the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the integrated stress response (ISR). Additionally, we describe how tumor cells have explored both NMD functions to promote tumorigenesis. Using published data and databases, we have also performed a network-based approach that further supports the link between NMD and these (patho) physiological processes.},
