abstract: '<p> Microbes have disproportionate impacts on the macroscopic world. This
  is in part due to their ability to grow to large populations that collectively secrete
  massive amounts of secondary metabolites and alter their environment. Yet, the conditions
  favoring secondary metabolism despite the potential costs for primary metabolism
  remain unclear. Here we investigated the biosurfactants that the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa</italic> makes and secretes to decrease the surface tension of surrounding
  liquid. Using a combination of genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and mathematical
  modeling we show that the ability to make surfactants from glycerol varies inconsistently
  across the phylogenetic tree; instead, lineages that lost this ability are also
  worse at reducing the oxidative stress of primary metabolism on glycerol. Experiments
  with different carbon sources support a link with oxidative stress that explains
  the inconsistent distribution across the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> phylogeny
  and suggests a general principle: <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lineages produce
  surfactants if they can reduce the oxidative stress produced by primary metabolism
  and have excess resources, beyond their primary needs, to afford secondary metabolism.
  These results add a new layer to the regulation of a secondary metabolite unessential
  for primary metabolism but important to change physical properties of the environments
  surrounding bacterial populations. </p>'
