abstract: To estimate the invasive disease potential of serotypes and clones circulating
  in Portugal before extensive use of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,
  we analyzed 475 invasive isolates recovered from children and adults and 769 carriage
  isolates recovered from children between 2001 and 2003. Isolates were serotyped
  and genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and a selection of isolates were
  also characterized by multilocus sequence typing. We found that the diversities
  of serotypes and genotypes of pneumococci responsible for invasive infections and
  carriage were identical and that most carried clones could also be detected as causes
  of invasive disease. Their ability to do so, however, varied substantially. Serotypes
  1, 3, 4, 5, 7F, 8, 9N, 9L, 12B, 14, 18C, and 20 were found to have an enhanced propensity
  to cause invasive disease, while serotypes 6A, 6B, 11A, 15B/C, 16F, 19F, 23F, 34,
  35F, and 37 were associated with carriage. In addition, significant differences
  in invasive disease potential between clones sharing the same serotype were found
  among several serotypes, namely, 3, 6A, 6B, 11A, 14, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, 34, and
  NT. This heterogeneous behavior of the clones was found irrespective of the serotype's
  overall invasive disease potential. Our results highlight the importance of the
  genetic background when analyzing the invasive disease potential of certain serotypes
  and provide an important baseline for its monitoring following conjugate vaccine
  use. Continuous surveillance should be maintained, and current research should focus
  on uncovering the genetic determinants that contribute to the heterogeneity of invasive
  disease potential of clones sharing the same serotype. Copyright © 2011, American
