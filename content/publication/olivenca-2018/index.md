abstract: © 2018 The Author(s). Phosphoinositides are signalling lipids that constitute
  a complex network regulating many cellular processes. We propose a computational
  model that accounts for all species of phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane
  of mammalian cells. The model replicates the steady-state of the pathway and most
  known dynamic phenomena. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates model robustness to alterations
  in the parameters. Model analysis suggest that the greatest contributor to phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) production is a flux representing the direct transformation
  of PI into PI(4,5)P2, also responsible for the maintenance of this pool when phosphatidylinositol
  4-phosphate (PI(4)P) is decreased. PI(5)P is also shown to be a significant source
  for PI(4,5)P2 production. The model was validated with siRNA screens that knocked
  down the expression of enzymes in the pathway. The screen monitored the activity
  of the epithelium sodium channel (ENaC), which is activated by PI(4,5)P2. While
  the model may deepen our understanding of other physiological processes involving
  phosphoinositides, we highlight therapeutic effects of ENaC modulation in Cystic
  Fibrosis (CF). The model suggests control strategies where the activities of the
  enzyme phosphoinositide 4-phosphate 5-kinase I (PIP5KI) or the PI4K + PIP5KI + DVL
  protein complex are decreased and cause an efficacious reduction in PI(4,5)P2 levels
  while avoiding undesirable alterations in other phosphoinositide pools.
