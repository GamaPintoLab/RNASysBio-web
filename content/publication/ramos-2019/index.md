abstract: © ENBENG 2019. All Rights Reserved. Diseases are caused by the deregulation
  of cellular networks, leading to faulty physiological functions. Different diseases
  can have common deregulated molecular pathways, particularly if they partially share
  phenotypes. These commonalities are frequently represented as an overlap of disease-related
  cellular subnetworks. The discovery of the overlaps and thus genes simultaneously
  associated with multiple diseases can shed light on the molecular pathomechanisms
  and provide new polyvalent therapeutic targets. This work builds upon a previously
  developed double specific-betweenness (S2B) network-based method, to prioritize
  proteins with a higher probability of being simultaneously associated with two phenotypically
  similar diseases. This method was designed to use undirected networks of protein
  physical interactions. The present work aims to expand the S2B method, enabling
  the analysis of networks with directed interactions, such as signaling and transcriptional
  regulatory cellular networks, providing new regulatory information and contributing
  to richer mechanistic hypothesis to explain the common physiological deficiencies.
  The new extended version of the method was tested with artificial disease modules,
  which enabled to test the S2B method ability to predict the overlap between the
  disease-related subnetworks. As in the undirected version of S2B, this novel version
  was applied to a pair of motor neuron diseases - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
  and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) -demonstrating once again its potential to bring
  new insights into the common pathological mechanisms and particularly, its ability
  to retrieve novel disease genes associated with the disturbance of regulatory mechanisms
  involved in motor neuron degeneration.
