abstract: In the rd/rd mouse, photoreceptor degeneration is due to a mutation of the
  rod-specific enzyme cGMP phosphodiesterase, resulting in permanently opened cGMP-gated
  cation channels in the rod outer segment membrane that allow Na + and Ca2+ ions
  to enter the cell, resulting in possibly toxic levels of Ca2+. To identify pathways
  involved in cell death of the rd/rd rods, we evaluated gene expression in the rd/rd
  and wild type (wt) mouse retina (U74A oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix)) over
  the known time course of photoreceptor degeneration. 181 genes passed the selection
  criteria (low standard deviation and high correlation between replicates), falling
  into six clusters. For any given pair of genes, an expression profile correlation
  distance and a semantic distance (one for each class of gene ontology terms) were
  established using newly designed software. Gene expression in rd/rd started to deviate
  from wt by postnatal day 10. The reduction in photoreceptor-specific genes followed
  the known time course of photoreceptor degeneration. Likewise the increase in transcription
  factors and apoptosis- and neuroinflammation- specific genes followed the kinetics
  of the rise in intracellular cGMP in the rod photoreceptors. In addition, genes
  coding for calcium-binding proteins and those implicated in tissue and vessel remodeling
  were increased. These results suggest that photoreceptor degeneration in the rd/rd
  mouse is a process starting with Ca2+ toxicity followed by secondary insults involving
  multidestructive pathways such as apoptosis and neuroinflammation, presumably boosting
  morphological changes. All of these components need to be addressed if rods are
  to be successfully protected.
