abstract: <p>Repetitive DNA is a major organizational component of eukaryotic genomes,
  being intrinsically related with their architecture and evolution. Tandemly repeated
  satellite DNAs (satDNAs) can be found clustered in specific heterochromatin-rich
  chromosomal regions, building vital structures like functional centromeres and also
  dispersed within euchromatin. Interestingly, despite their association to critical
  chromosomal structures, satDNAs are widely variable among species due to their high
  turnover rates. This dynamic behavior has been associated with genome plasticity
  and chromosome rearrangements, leading to the reshaping of genomes. Here we present
  the current knowledge regarding satDNAs in the light of new genomic technologies,
  and the challenges in the study of these sequences. Furthermore, we discuss how
  these sequences, together with other repeats, influence genome architecture, impacting
  its evolution and association with disease.</p>
