 abstract = {We propose a new coefficient, the adjusted Wallace coefficient (AW), and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) as quantitative measures of congruence between typing methods. The performance of the derived CI was evaluated using simulated data. Published microbial typing data were used to demonstrate the advantages of AW over the Wallace coefficient.
