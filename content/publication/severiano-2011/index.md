abstract: We propose a new coefficient, the adjusted Wallace coefficient (AW), and
  corresponding confidence intervals (CI) as quantitative measures of congruence between
  typing methods. The performance of the derived CI was evaluated using simulated
  data. Published microbial typing data were used to demonstrate the advantages of
  AW over the Wallace coefficient. Copyright © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.
