abstract: Several research fields frequently deal with the analysis of diverse classification
  results of the same entities. This should imply an objective detection of overlaps
  and divergences between the formed clusters. The congruence between classifications
  can be quantified by clustering agreement measures, including pairwise agreement
  measures. Several measures have been proposed and the importance of obtaining confidence
  intervals for the point estimate in the comparison of these measures has been highlighted.
  A broad range of methods can be used for the estimation of confidence intervals.
  However, evidence is lacking about what are the appropriate methods for the calculation
  of confidence intervals for most clustering agreement measures. Here we evaluate
  the resampling techniques of bootstrap and jackknife for the calculation of the
  confidence intervals for clustering agreement measures. Contrary to what has been
  shown for some statistics, simulations showed that the jackknife performs better
  than the bootstrap at accurately estimating confidence intervals for pairwise agreement
  measures, especially when the agreement between partitions is low. The coverage
  of the jackknife confidence interval is robust to changes in cluster number and
  cluster size distribution. © 2011 Severiano et al.
