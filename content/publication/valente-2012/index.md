abstract: "Understanding the epidemiology of pneumococcal co-colonization is important\
  \ for monitoring vaccine effectiveness and the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer\
  \ between pneumococcal strains. In this study we aimed to evaluate the impact of\
  \ the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) on pneumococcal co-colonization\
  \ among Portuguese children. Nasopharyngeal samples from children up to 6 years\
  \ old yielding a pneumococcal culture were clustered into three groups: pre-vaccine\
  \ era (n = 173), unvaccinated children of the vaccine era (n = 169), and fully vaccinated\
  \ children (4 doses; n = 150). Co-colonization, serotype identification, and relative\
  \ serotype abundance were detected by analysis of DNA of the total bacterial growth\
  \ of the primary culture plate using the plyNCR-RFLP method and a molecular serotyping\
  \ microarray-based strategy. The plyNCR-RFLP method detected an overall co-colonization\
  \ rate of 20.1%. Microarray analysis confirmed the plyNCR-RFLP results. Vaccination\
  \ status was the only factor found to be significantly associated with co-colonization:\
  \ co-colonization rates were significantly lower (p = 0.004; Fisher's exact test)\
  \ among fully vaccinated children (8.0%) than among children from the pre-PCV7 era\
  \ (17.3%) or unvaccinated children of the PCV7 era (18.3%). In the PCV7 era there\
  \ were significantly less non-vaccine type (NVT) co-colonization events than would\
  \ be expected based on the NVT distribution observed in the pre-PCV7 era (p = 0.024).\
  \ In conclusion, vaccination with PCV7 resulted in a lower co-colonization rate\
  \ due to an asymmetric distribution between NVTs found in single and co-colonized\
  \ samples. We propose that some NVTs prevalent in the PCV7 era are more competitive\
  \ than others, hampering their co-existence in the same niche. This result may have\
  \ important implications since a decrease in co-colonization events is expected\
  \ to translate in decreased opportunities for horizontal gene transfer, hindering\
  \ pneumococcal evolution events such as acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants\
  \ or capsular switch. This might represent a novel potential benefit of conjugate\
  \ vaccines. © 2012 Valente et al."
