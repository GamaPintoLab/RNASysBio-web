abstract: Protein misfolding disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson and transthyretin
  amyloidosis are characterized by the formation of protein amyloid deposits. Although
  the nature and location of the aggregated proteins varies between different diseases,
  they all share similar molecular pathways of protein unfolding, aggregation and
  amyloid deposition. Most effects of these proteins are likely to occur at the proteome
  level, a virtually unexplored reality. To investigate the effects of an amyloid
  protein expression on the cellular proteome, we created a yeast expression system
  using human transthyretin (TTR) as a model amyloidogenic protein. We used Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae, a living test tube, to express native TTR (non-amyloidogenic) and the
  amyloidogenic TTR variant L55P, the later forming aggregates when expressed in yeast.
  Differential proteome changes were quantitatively analyzed by 2D-differential in
  gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). We show that the expression of the amyloidogenic
  TTR-L55P causes a metabolic shift towards energy production, increased superoxide
  dismutase expression as well as of several molecular chaperones involved in protein
  refolding. Among these chaperones, members of the HSP70 family and the peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans
  isomerase (PPIase) were identified. The latter is highly relevant considering that
  it was previously found to be a TTR interacting partner in the plasma of ATTR patients
  but not in healthy or asymptomatic subjects. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)
  expression is also increased. Our findings suggest that refolding and degradation
  pathways are activated, causing an increased demand of energetic resources, thus
  the metabolic shift. Additionally, oxidative stress appears to be a consequence
  of the amyloidogenic process, posing an enhanced threat to cell survival. Â© 2012
