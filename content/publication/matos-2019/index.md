abstract: Â© 2019 Matos et al. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by
  mutations in the gene encoding CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a
  chloride channel normally expressed at the surface of epithelial cells. The most
  frequent mutation, resulting in Phe-508 deletion, causes CFTR misfolding and its
  premature degradation. Low temperature or pharmacological correctors can partly
  rescue the Phe508del-CFTR processing defect and enhance trafficking of this channel
  variant to the plasma membrane (PM). Nevertheless, the rescued channels have an
  increased endocytosis rate, being quickly removed from the PM by the peripheral
  protein quality-control pathway. We previously reported that rescued Phe508del-CFTR
  (rPhe508del) can be retained at the cell surface by stimulating signaling pathways
  that coax the adaptor molecule ezrin (EZR) to tether rPhe508del-Na+/H+-exchange
  regulatory factor-1 complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby averting the rapid
  internalization of this channel variant. However, the molecular basis for why rPhe508del
  fails to recruit active EZR to the PM remains elusive. Here, using a proteomics
  approach, we characterized and compared the core components of wt-CFTR- or rPhe508del-containing
  macromolecular complexes at the surface of human bronchial epithelial cells. We
  identified calpain 1 (CAPN1) as an exclusive rPhe508del interactor that prevents
  active EZR recruitment, impairs rPhe508del anchoring to actin, and reduces its stability
  in the PM. We show that either CAPN1down-regulation or its chemical inhibition dramatically
  improves the functional rescue of Phe508del-CFTR in airway cells. These observations
  suggest that CAPN1 constitutes an appealing target for pharmacological intervention,
  as part of CF combination therapies restoring Phe508del-CFTR function.
