abstract: <p> <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> , a global worm parasite of humans
  and their livestock, regulates host innate immune responses within hours of infection.
  Host macrophages, essential to the first-line defence mechanisms, are quickly restricted
  in their ability to initiate a classic protective pro-inflammatory immune response.
  We found that macrophages from infected animals are enriched with parasite-derived
  micro(mi)RNAs. The most abundant of these miRNAs, <italic>fhe-miR-125b</italic>
  , is released by the parasite via exosomes and is homologous to a mammalian miRNA,
  <italic>hsa-miR-125b</italic> , that is known to regulate the activation of pro-inflammatory
  M1 macrophages. We show that the parasite <italic>fhe-miR-125b</italic> loads onto
  the mammalian Argonaut protein (Ago-2) within macrophages during infection and,
  therefore, propose that it mimics host <italic>miR-125b</italic> to negatively regulate
  the production of inflammatory cytokines. The hijacking of the miRNA machinery controlling
  innate cell function could be a fundamental mechanism by which worm parasites disarm
  the early immune responses of their host to ensure successful infection. </p>
