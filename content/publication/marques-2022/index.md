abstract: <p>microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play a key role in regulating
  gene expression. These molecules exert their function through sequence complementarity
  with microRNA responsive elements and are typically located in the 3′ untranslated
  region of mRNAs, negatively regulating expression. Even though the relevant role
  of miRNA-dependent regulation is broadly recognized, the principles governing their
  ability to lead to specific functional outcomes in distinct cell types are still
  not well understood. In recent years, an intriguing hypothesis proposed that miRNA-responsive
  elements act as communication links between different RNA species, making the investigation
  of microRNA function even more complex than previously thought. The competing endogenous
  RNA hypothesis suggests the presence of a new level of regulation, whereby a specific
  RNA transcript can indirectly influence the abundance of other transcripts by limiting
  the availability of a common miRNA, acting as a “molecular sponge”. Since this idea
  has been proposed, several studies have tried to pinpoint the interaction networks
  that have been established between different RNA species and whether they contribute
  to normal cell function and disease. The focus of this review is to highlight recent
  developments and achievements made towards the process of characterizing competing
  endogenous RNA networks and their role in cellular function.</p>
