abstract: © 2018 The Authors The formation of distinct 3′UTRs through alternative
  polyadenylation is a mechanism of gene expression regulation that has been implicated
  in many physiological and pathological processes. However, its functions in the
  context of vertebrate embryonic development have been largely unaddressed, in particular
  with a gene-specific focus. Here we show that the most abundant 3′UTR for the zebrafish
  fgf8a gene in the developing embryo mediates a strong translational repression,
  when compared to a more sparsely used alternative 3′UTR, which supports a higher
  translation efficiency. By inducing a shift in the selection efficiency of the associated
  polyadenylation sites, we show a temporally and spatially specific impact of fgf8a
  3′UTR usage on embryogenesis, in particular at late stages during sensory system
  development. In addition, we identified a previously undescribed role for Fgf signalling
  in the initial stages of superficial retinal vascularization. These results reveal
  a critical functional importance of gene-specific alternative 3′UTRs in vertebrate
  embryonic development.
