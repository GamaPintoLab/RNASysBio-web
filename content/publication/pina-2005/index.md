abstract: Upon germination, pollen forms a tube that elongates dramatically through
  female tissues to reach and fertilize ovules. While essential for the life cycle
  of higher plants, the genetic basis underlying most of the process is not well understood.
  We previously used a combination of flow cytometry sorting of viable hydrated pollen
  grains and GeneChip array analysis of one-third of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
  thaliana) genome to define a first overview of the pollen transcriptome. We now
  extend that study to approximately 80% of the genome of Arabidopsis by using Affymetrix
  Arabidopsis ATH1 arrays and perform comparative analysis of gene family and gene
  ontology representation in the transcriptome of pollen and vegetative tissues. Pollen
  grains have a smaller and overall unique transcriptome (6,587 genes expressed) with
  greater proportions of selectively expressed (11%) and enriched (26%) genes than
  any vegetative tissue. Relative gene ontology category representations in pollen
  and vegetative tissues reveal a functional skew of the pollen transcriptome toward
  signaling, vesicle transport, and the cytoskeleton, suggestive of a commitment to
  germination and tube growth. Cell cycle analysis reveals an accumulation of G2/M-associated
  factors that may play a role in the first mitotic division of the zygote. Despite
  the relative underrepresentation of transcription-associated transcripts, nonclassical
  MADS box genes emerge as a class with putative unique roles in pollen. The singularity
  of gene expression control in mature pollen grains is further highlighted by the
  apparent absence of small RNA pathway components. © 2005 American Society of Plant
