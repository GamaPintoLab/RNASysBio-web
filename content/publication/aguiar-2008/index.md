abstract: Background. Pili were recently recognized in Streptococcus pneumoniae and
  implicated in the virulence of this bacterium, which led to the proposal of using
  these antigens in a future pneumococcal vaccine. However, pili were found to be
  encoded by the rlrA islet that was not universally distributed in the species. We
  examined the distribution of the pilus islet, using the presence of the rlrA gene
  as a marker for the locus, among a collection of invasive isolates recovered in
  Portugal and analyzed its association with capsular serotypes, clusters defined
  by the pulsed-field gel electrophoretic profiles (PFGE) and multilocus sequence
  types. Results. Only a minority of the isolates were positive for the presence of
  the rlrA gene (27%). There was a high correspondence between the serotype and the
  presence or absence of rlrA (Wallace coefficient, W = 0.778). In particular, there
  was an association between the presence of rlrA and the vaccine serotypes 4, 6B,
  9V and 14 whereas the gene was significantly absent from other serotypes, namely
  1, 7F, 8, 12B and 23F, a group that included a vaccine serotype (23F) and serotype
  1 associated with enhanced invasiveness. Even within serotypes, there was variation
  in the presence of the pilus islet between PFGE clones and a higher Wallace coefficient
  (W = 0.939) indicates that carriage of the islet is a clonal property of pneumococci.
  Analysis of rlrA negative isolates revealed heterogeneity in the genomic region
  downstream of the rfl gene, the region where the islet is found in other isolates,
  compatible with recent loss of the islet in some lineages. Conclusion. The pilus
  islet is present in a minority of pneumococcal isolates recovered from human invasive
  infections and is therefore not an essential virulence factor in these infections.
  Carriage of the pilus islet is a clonal property of pneumococci that may vary between
  isolates expressing the same serotype and loss and acquisition of the islet may
  be ongoing. Â© 2008 Aguiar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.
