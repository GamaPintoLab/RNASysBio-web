abstract: 'Background: Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is
  used for rapid comparison of genomes of different bacterial strains. The purpose
  is to evaluate the distribution of genes from sequenced bacterial strains (control)
  among unsequenced strains (test). We previously compared the use of single strain
  versus multiple strain control with arrays covering multiple genomes. The conclusion
  was that a multiple strain control promoted a better separation of signals between
  present and absent genes. Findings. We now extend our previous study by applying
  the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit a mixture model to the signal
  distribution in order to classify each gene as present or absent and by comparing
  different methods for analyzing aCGH data, using combinations of different control
  strain choices, two different statistical mixture models, with or without normalization,
  with or without logarithm transformation and with test-over-control or inverse signal
  ratio calculation. We also assessed the impact of replication on classification
  accuracy. Higher values of accuracy have been achieved using the ratio of control-over-test
  intensities, without logarithmic transformation and with a strain mix control. Normalization
  and the type of mixture model fitted by the EM algorithm did not have a significant
  impact on classification accuracy. Similarly, using the average of replicate arrays
  to perform the classification does not significantly improve the results. Conclusions:
  Our work provides a guiding benchmark comparison of alternative methods to analyze
  aCGH results that can impact on the analysis of currently ongoing comparative genomic
  projects or in the re-analysis of published studies. Â© 2014 Cardoso et al.; licensee
