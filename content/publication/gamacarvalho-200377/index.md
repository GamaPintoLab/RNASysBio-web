abstract: Subcellular compartmentalization of splicing factors has been proposed to
  play a role in the regulation of alternative splicing. In the present work we have
  addressed this issue using adenovirus-infected cells to visualize an alternative
  splicing switch at the single cell level. The adenovirus gene expression program
  requires the activation of distal alternative 3′ splice sites during the late phase
  of infection in major late transcripts. We have established in situ hybridization
  conditions that allow for the specific detection of 3′ alternatively spliced adenoviral
  mRNAs from the L1 transcript family. Results show that the switch from proximal
  to distal 3′ splice sites correlates with a massive reorganization of splicing factors
  in the cell nucleus, involving their recruitment from nuclear speckles to sites
  of viral transcription. This observation raises the possibility that the subnuclear
  organization of splicing factors may be regulated in response to events that lead
  to the activation of alternative splicing programs.
