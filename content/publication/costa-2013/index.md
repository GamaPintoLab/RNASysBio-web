abstract: Recent findings have shown that the blood vessels of different organs exert
  an active role in regulating organ function. In detail, the endothelium that aligns
  the vasculature of most organs is fundamental in maintaining organ homeostasis and
  in promoting organ recovery following injury. Mechanistically, endothelial cells
  (EC) of tissues such as the liver, lungs or the bone marrow (BM) have been shown
  to produce \"angiocrine\" factors that promote organ recovery and restore normal
  organ function. Controlled production of angiocrine factors following organ injury
  is therefore essential to promote organ regeneration and to restore organ function.
  However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated production and function
  of such \"angiocrine\" factors are largely undisclosed and were the subject of the
  present study. In detail, we identified for the first time a microRNA (miRNA) expressed
  by BM EC that regulates the expression of angiocrine genes involved in BM recovery
  following irradiation. Using a microarray-based approach, we identified several
  miRNA expressed by irradiated BMEC. After validating the variations in miRNA expression
  by semi-quantitative PCR, we chose to study further the ones showing consistent
  variations between experiments, and those predicted to regulate (directly or indirectly)
  angiogenic and angiocrine factors. Of the mi-RNA that were chosen, miR-363-5p (previously
  termed miR-363*) was subsequently shown to modulate the expression of numerous EC-specific
  genes including some angiocrine factors. By luciferase reporter assays, miR-363-5p
  is shown to regulate the expression of angiocrine factors tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1
  (Timp-1) and thrombospondin 3 (THBS3) at post-transcriptional level. Moreover, miR-363-5p
  reduction using anti-miR is shown to affect EC angiogenic properties (such as the
  response to angiogenic factors stimulation) and the interaction between EC and hematopoietic
  precursors (particularly relevant in a BM setting). miR-363-5p reduction resulted
  in a significant decrease in EC tube formation on matrigel, but increased hematopoietic
  precursor cells adhesion onto EC, a mechanism that is shown to involve kit ligand-mediated
  cell adhesion. Taken together, we have identified a miRNA induced by irradiation
  that regulates angiocrine factors expression on EC and as such modulates EC properties.
  Further studies on the importance of miR-363-5p on normal BM function and in disease
  are warranted. © 2013 Costa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.
