abstract: <p>Familial hypercholesterolaemia increases circulating LDL-C levels and
  leads to premature cardiovascular disease when undiagnosed or untreated. Current
  guidelines support genetic testing in patients complying with clinical diagnostic
  criteria and cascade screening of their family members. However, most of hyperlipidaemic
  subjects do not present pathogenic variants in the known disease genes, and most
  likely suffer from polygenic hypercholesterolaemia, which translates into a relatively
  low yield of genetic screening programs. This study aims to identify new biomarkers
  and develop new approaches to improve the identification of individuals carrying
  monogenic causative variants. Using a machine-learning approach in a paediatric
  dataset of individuals, tested for disease causative genes and with an extended
  lipid profile, we developed new models able to classify familial hypercholesterolaemia
  patients with a much higher specificity than currently used methods. The best performing
  models incorporated parameters absent from the most common FH clinical criteria, namely
  apoB/apoA-I, TG/apoB and LDL1. These parameters were found to contribute to an improved
  identification of monogenic individuals. Furthermore, models using only TC and LDL-C
  levels presented a higher specificity of classification when compared to simple
  cut-offs. Our results can be applied towards the improvement of the yield of genetic
  screening programs and corresponding costs.</p>
