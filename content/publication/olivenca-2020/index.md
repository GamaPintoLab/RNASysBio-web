abstract: '<p> Cystic fibrosis is a condition caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis
  transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). It is also thought to increase the activity
  of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The altered function of these ion channels
  is one of the causes of the thick dehydrated mucus that characterizes the disease
  and is partially responsible for recurrent pulmonary infections and inflammation
  events that ultimately destroy the lungs of affected subjects. Phosphoinositides
  are signaling lipids that regulate numerous cellular processes and membrane proteins,
  including ENaC. Inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), an enzyme of the phosphoinositide
  pathway, reduces ENaC function. We propose a computational analysis that is based
  on the combination of two existing mathematical models: one representing the dynamics
  of phosphoinositides and the other explaining how phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PI(4,5)P <sub>2</sub> ) influences ENaC activity and, consequently, airway surface
  liquid. This integrated model permits, for the first time, a detailed assessment
  of the intricate interactions between DGK and ENaC and is consistent with available
  literature data. In particular, the computational approach allows comparisons of
  two competing hypotheses regarding the regulation of ENaC. The results strongly
  suggest that the regulation of ENaC is primarily exerted through the control of
  PI(4,5)P <sub>2</sub> production by type-I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase
  (PIP5KI), which in turn is controlled by phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of
  the DGK reaction. </p>'
