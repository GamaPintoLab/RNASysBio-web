abstract: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is able to form biofilms in vivo
  and previous studies propose that pneumococcal biofilms play a relevant role both
  in colonization and infection. Additionally, pneumococci recovered from human infections
  are characterized by a high prevalence of lysogenic bacteriophages (phages) residing
  quiescently in their host chromosome. We investigated a possible link between lysogeny
  and biofilm formation. Considering that extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a key factor
  in the biofilm matrix, we reasoned that prophage spontaneous activation with the
  consequent bacterial host lysis could provide a source of eDNA, enhancing pneumococcal
  biofilm development. Monitoring biofilm growth of lysogenic and non-lysogenic pneumococcal
  strains indicated that phage-infected bacteria are more proficient at forming biofilms,
  that is their biofilms are characterized by a higher biomass and cell viability.
  The presence of phage particles throughout the lysogenic strains biofilm development
  implicated prophage spontaneous induction in this effect. Analysis of lysogens deficient
  for phage lysin and the bacterial major autolysin revealed that the absence of either
  lytic activity impaired biofilm development and the addition of DNA restored the
  ability of mutant strains to form robust biofilms. These findings establish that
  limited phage-mediated host lysis of a fraction of the bacterial population, due
  to spontaneous phage induction, constitutes an important source of eDNA for the
  S. pneumoniae biofilm matrix and that this localized release of eDNA favors biofilm
  formation by the remaining bacterial population. Â© 2010 Carrolo et al.
