abstract: <p>The premessenger RNA of the majority of human genes can generate various
  transcripts through alternative splicing, and different tissues or disease states
  show specific patterns of splicing variants. These patterns depend on the relative
  concentrations of the splicing factors present in the cell nucleus, either as a
  consequence of their expression levels or of post-translational modifications, such
  as protein phosphorylation, which are determined by signal transduction pathways.
  Here, we analyzed the contribution of protein kinases to the regulation of alternative
  splicing variant Rac1b that is overexpressed in certain tumor types. In colorectal
  cells, we found that depletion of AKT2, AKT3, GSK3β, and SRPK1 significantly decreased
  endogenous Rac1b levels. Although knockdown of AKT2 and AKT3 affected only Rac1b
  protein levels suggesting a post-splicing effect, the depletion of GSK3β or SRPK1
  decreased Rac1b alternative splicing, an effect mediated through changes in splicing
  factor SRSF1. In particular, the knockdown of SRPK1 or inhibition of its catalytic
  activity reduced phosphorylation and subsequent translocation of SRSF1 to the nucleus,
  limiting its availability to promote the inclusion of alternative exon 3b into the
  Rac1 pre-mRNA. Altogether, the data identify SRSF1 as a prime regulator of Rac1b
  expression in colorectal cells and provide further mechanistic insight into how
  the regulation of alternative splicing events by protein kinases can contribute
  to sustain tumor cell survival.</p>
