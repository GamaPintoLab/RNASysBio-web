abstract: Â© 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis
  transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause the recessive genetic disease
  cystic fibrosis, where the chloride transport across the apical membrane of epithelial
  cells mediated by the CFTR protein is impaired. CFTR protein trafficking to the
  plasma membrane (PM) is the result of a complex interplay between the secretory
  and membrane recycling pathways that control the number of channels present at the
  membrane. In addition, the ion transport activity of CFTR at the PM is modulated
  through post-translational protein modifications. Previously we described that spleen
  tyrosine kinase (SYK) phosphorylates a specific tyrosine residue in the nucleotide-binding
  domain 1 domain and this modification can regulate the PM abundance of CFTR. Here
  we identified the underlying biochemical mechanism using peptide pull-down assays
  followed by mass spectrometry. We identified in bronchial epithelial cells that
  the adaptor protein SHC1 recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated CFTR through its phosphotyrosine-binding
  domain and that the formation of a complex between SHC1 and CFTR is induced at the
  PM in the presence of activated SYK. The depletion of endogenous SHC1 expression
  was sufficient to promote an increase in CFTR at the PM of these cells. The results
  identify a SYK/SHC1 pathway that regulates the PM levels of CFTR channels, contributing
  to a better understanding of how CFTR-mediated chloride secretion is regulated.
