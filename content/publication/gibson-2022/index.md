abstract: <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial regulators of cellular processes, including
  metabolism. Attempts to use miRNAs as therapeutic agents are being explored in several
  areas, including the control of cancer progression. Recent evidence suggests fine
  tuning miRNA activity to reprogram tumor cell metabolism has enormous potential
  as an alternative treatment option. Indeed, cancer growth is known to be linked
  to profound metabolic changes. Likewise, the emerging field of immunometabolism
  is leading to a refined understanding of how immune cell proliferation and function
  is governed by glucose homeostasis. Different immune cell types are now known to
  have unique metabolic signatures that switch in response to a changing environment.
  T-cell subsets exhibit distinct metabolic profiles which underlie their alternative
  differentiation and phenotypic functions. Recent evidence shows that the susceptibility
  of CD4+ T-cells to HIV infection is intimately linked to their metabolic activity,
  with many of the metabolic features of HIV-1-infected cells resembling those found
  in tumor cells. In this review, we discuss the use of miRNA modulation to achieve
  metabolic reprogramming for cancer therapy and explore the idea that the same approach
  may serve as an effective mechanism to restrict HIV replication and eliminate infected
  cells.</p>
