 abstract = {<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial regulators of cellular processes, including metabolism. Attempts to use miRNAs as therapeutic agents are being explored in several areas, including the control of cancer progression. Recent evidence suggests fine tuning miRNA activity to reprogram tumor cell metabolism has enormous potential as an alternative treatment option. Indeed, cancer growth is known to be linked to profound metabolic changes. Likewise, the emerging field of immunometabolism is leading to a refined understanding of how immune cell proliferation and function is governed by glucose homeostasis. Different immune cell types are now known to have unique metabolic signatures that switch in response to a changing environment. T-cell subsets exhibit distinct metabolic profiles which underlie their alternative differentiation and phenotypic functions. Recent evidence shows that the susceptibility of CD4+ T-cells to HIV infection is intimately linked to their metabolic activity, with many of the metabolic features of HIV-1-infected cells resembling those found in tumor cells. In this review, we discuss the use of miRNA modulation to achieve metabolic reprogramming for cancer therapy and explore the idea that the same approach may serve as an effective mechanism to restrict HIV replication and eliminate infected cells.</p>},
