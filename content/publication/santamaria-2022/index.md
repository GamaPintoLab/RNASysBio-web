abstract: <p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is composed
  of several lineages characterized by a genome identity higher than 99%. Although
  the majority of the lineages are associated with humans, at least four lineages
  are adapted to other mammals, including different M. tuberculosis ecotypes. Host
  specificity is associated with higher virulence in its preferred host in ecotypes
  such as M. bovis. Deciphering what determines the preference of the host can reveal
  host-specific virulence patterns. However, it is not clear which genomic determinants
  might be influencing host specificity. In this study, we apply a combination of
  unsupervised and supervised classification methods on genomic data of ~27,000 M.
  tuberculosis clinical isolates to decipher host-specific genomic determinants. Host-specific
  genomic signatures are scarce beyond known lineage-specific mutations. Therefore,
  we integrated lineage-specific mutations into the iEK1011 2.0 genome-scale metabolic
  model to obtain lineage-specific versions of it. Flux distributions sampled from
  the solution spaces of these models can be accurately separated according to host
  association. This separation correlated with differences in cell wall processes,
  lipid, amino acid and carbon metabolic subsystems. These differences were observable
  when more than 95% of the samples had a specific growth rate significantly lower
  than the maximum achievable by the models. This suggests that these differences
  might manifest at low growth rate settings, such as the restrictive conditions M.
