abstract: 'Background: A few lineages of Group A streptococci (GAS) have been associated
  with a reemergence of severe invasive streptococcal disease in developed countries.
  However, the majority of the comparisons between invasive and non-invasive GAS isolates
  have been performed for collections of reduced genetic diversity or relied on limited
  typing information to distinguish clones. We characterized by several typing methods
  and compared a collection of 160 isolates recovered from normally sterile sites
  with 320 isolates associated with pharyngitis and recovered in the same time period
  in Portugal. Results: Although most of the isolates belonged to clones that were
  equally prevalent in invasive infections and pharyngitis, we identified markers
  of invasiveness, namely the emm types 1 and 64, and the presence of the speA and
  speJ genes. In contrast, emm4, emm75, and the ssa and speL/M genes were significantly
  associated with pharyngitis. There was a strong agreement between the emm type,
  the superantigen (SAg) genes and the clusters defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
  (PFGE) profiling. Therefore, combinations of particular emm types and SAg genes
  frequently co-occurred in the same PFGE cluster, but there was no synergistic or
  antagonistic interaction between them in determining invasiveness. Only macrolide-susceptible
  PFGE clones were significantly associated with invasive infections or pharyngitis,
  while the clones of resistant isolates sharing all other molecular properties analyzed
  were equally prevalent in the two groups of isolates. Conclusions: This study confirmed
  the importance of the widely disseminated emm1-T1-ST28 clone in invasive infections
  but also identified other clones linked to either invasive infections (emm64-ST164)
  or pharyngitis (emm4-T4-ST39), which may be more limited in their temporal and geographical
  spread. Clonal properties like some emm types or SAg genes were associated with
  disease presentation, highlighting the importance of bacterial genetic factors to
  the outcome of GAS infections, although other, yet unidentified factors may also
  play an important role. © 2012 Friães et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.'
