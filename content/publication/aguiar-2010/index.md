abstract: Pneumococci of serotype 19A are increasingly found to be the cause of infection
  in various geographic regions. We have characterized the serotype 19A isolates (n
  = 288) found among pneumococci responsible for infections (n = 1,925) and pneumococci
  recovered from asymptomatic carriers (n = 1,973) in Portugal between 2001 and 2006.
  We show that despite the existence of serotype 19A clones that have a greater potential
  to cause invasive disease or an enhanced colonization capacity, the lineage that
  is increasing as a cause of infection in Portugal is a multiresistant clone that
  is competent at both. The expanding Denmark14-230 clone found in Portugal is disseminated
  in other Mediterranean countries, where it is also increasingly responsible for
  invasive infections in both children and adults. The lineages driving the rise of
  serotype 19A infections in Asia and the United States (sequence type 320 [ST320]
  and ST199) are either absent or account for only a small proportion of isolates
  in Portugal. These data highlight the importance of locally circulating clones with
  the ability to compete in the nasopharyngeal niche in the emergence of the serotype
  19A lineages which are an increasing cause of infection in various geographic regions.
