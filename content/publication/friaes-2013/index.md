abstract: The profiling of the superantigen (SAg) encoding genes has been frequently
  used as a complementary typing method for group A streptococci (GAS), but a confusing
  gene nomenclature and a large diversity of primers used in screening has led to
  some conflicting results. The aim of this work was to develop a polymerase chain
  reaction (PCR) method capable of efficiently amplifying all the known allelic variants
  of these genes, and to evaluate the congruence of this methodology with other commonly
  used molecular typing methods. The presence of the 11 known SAg genes and two other
  exotoxin-encoding genes (speB and speF) was tested in a collection of 480 clinical
  GAS isolates, using two multiplex PCR reactions. The SAg gene profile was compared
  with other typing methods. Four naturally occurring deletions involving the genes
  speB, speF, and rgg were characterized, two of which were found among invasive isolates.
  The absence of the chromosomally encoded genes speG and smeZ was supported by Southern
  blot hybridization and associated with specific GAS lineages, while the presence
  of phage-encoded genes was more variable. Positive associations between SAg genes
  or between SAg profiles and emm types or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
  clusters were observed. The results suggest that the SAg profile diversifies faster
  than other properties commonly used for molecular typing, such as emm type and multilocus
  sequence typing (MLST) sequence types (STs), and can be a useful complement in GAS
  molecular epidemiology. Still, the short-term stability of the SAg gene profile
  among prevalent genetic lineages may largely explain the observed associations between
  SAg genes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
