abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated roles for de novo production of sphingolipids
  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the regulation of the transient cell cycle arrest
  and nutrient permease degradation associated with the heat stress response, suggesting
  multiple functions for yeast sphingolipids in this response. We, therefore, sought
  to determine the generalized involvement of sphingolipids in the heat stress response
  by using microarray hybridization of RNA isolated from heat-stressed cultures of
  the mutant strain lcb1-100, which is unable to produce sphingolipids in response
  to heat. Approximately 70 genes showed differential regulation during the first
  15 min of heat stress in the lcb1-100 strain compared with the wild type strain,
  indicating a requirement for de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis for proper regulation
  of these genes during heat stress. Grouping these genes into functional categories
  revealed several pathways, including some in which sphingolipids were previously
  suspected to play a role, such as stress response pathways and cell cycle regulation.
  Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed sphingolipid involvement in regulation
  of tRNA synthesis and metabolic genes and transporters. Additionally, the microarray
  results demonstrated novel sphingolipid involvement in transcriptional regulation
  of pathways of translation and cell wall organization and biogenesis. Our results
  demonstrate a broad-reaching effect of sphingolipids in the yeast heat stress response
  and suggest that the mechanism of sphingolipid involvement in several cellular pathways
  occurs via sphingolipid-mediated regulation of message levels.
