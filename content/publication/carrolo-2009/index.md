abstract: Background. The boundaries of bacterial species and the mechanisms underlying
  bacterial speciation are matters of intense debate. Theoretical studies have shown
  that recombination acts as a strong cohesive force preventing divergence in bacterial
  populations. Streptococcus pneumoniae populations have the telltale signs of high
  recombination with competence implicated as the major driving force behind gene
  exchange. Competence in S. pneumoniae is triggered by a quorum-sensing mechanism
  controlled by the competence-stimulating peptide pheromone. Results. We studied
  the distribution of the two major pherotypes in the pneumococcal population and
  their association with serotype, antimicrobial resistance and genetic lineage. Using
  multilocus sequence data we evaluated pherotype influence on the dynamics of horizontal
  gene transfer. We show that pherotype is a clonal property of pneumococci. Standard
  population genetic analysis and multilocus infinite allele model simulations support
  the hypothesis that two genetically differentiated populations are defined by the
  major pherotypes. Conclusion. Severe limitations to gene flow can therefore occur
  in bacterial species in the absence of geographical barriers and within highly recombinogenic
  populations. This departure from panmixia can have important consequences for our
  understanding of the response of pneumococci to human imposed selective pressures
  such as vaccination and antibiotic use. Â© 2009 Carrolo et al; licensee BioMed Central
