abstract: The studies that correlate the results obtained by different typing methodologies
  rely solely on qualitative comparisons of the groups defined by each methodology.
  We propose a framework of measures for the quantitative assessment of correspondences
  between different typing methods as a first step to the global mapping of type equivalences.
  A collection of 325 macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes isolates associated
  with pharyngitis cases in Portugal was used to benchmark the proposed measures.
  All isolates were characterized by macrolide resistance phenotyping, T serotyping,
  emm sequence typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), using SmaI or
  Cfr9I and SfiI. A subset of 41 isolates, representing each PFGE cluster, was also
  characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The application of Adjusted
  Rand and Wallace indices allowed the evaluation of the strength and the directionality
  of the correspondences between the various typing methods and showed that if PFGE
  or MLST data are available one can confidently predict the emm type (Wallace coefficients
  of 0.952 for both methods). In contrast, emm typing was a poor predictor of PFGE
  cluster or MLST sequence type (Wallace coefficients of 0.803 and 0.655, respectively).
  This was confirmed by the analysis of the larger data set available from http://spyogenes.mlst.net
  and underscores the necessity of performing PFGE or MLST to unambiguously define
  clones in S. pyogenes. Copyright © 2006, American Society for Microbiology. All
