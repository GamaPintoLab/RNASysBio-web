abstract: 'Background: Microarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) evaluates
  the distribution of genes of sequenced bacterial strains among unsequenced strains
  of the same or related species. As genomic sequences from multiple strains of the
  same species become available, multistrain microarrays are designed, containing
  spots for every unique gene in all sequenced strains. To perform two-color aCGH
  experiments with multistrain microarrays, the choice of control sample can be the
  genomic DNA of one strain or a mixture of all the strains used in the array design.
  This important problem has no universally accepted solution. Results: We performed
  a comparative study of the two control sample options with a Streptococcus pneumoniae
  microarray designed with three fully sequenced strains. We separately hybridized
  two of these strains (R6 and G54) as test samples using the third strain alone (TIGR4)
  or a mixture of the three strains as control. We show that for both types of control
  it is advantageous to analyze spots in separate sets according to their expected
  control channel signal (5-15% AUC increase). Following this analysis, the use of
  a mix control leads to higher accuracies (5% increase). This enhanced performance
  is due to gains in sensitivity (21% increase, p = 0.001) that compensate minor losses
  in specificity (5% decrease, p = 0.014). Conclusion: The use of a single strain
  control increases the error rate in genes that are part of the accessory genome,
  where more variation across unsequenced strains is expected, further justifying
  the use of the mix control. Â© 2008 Pinto et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.'
