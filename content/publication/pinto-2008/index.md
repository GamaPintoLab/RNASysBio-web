abstract: Very diverse research fields frequently deal with the analysis of multiple
  clustering results, which should imply an objective detection of overlaps and divergences
  between the formed groupings. The congruence between these multiple results can
  be quantified by clustering comparison measures such as the Wallace coefficient
  (W). Since the measured congruence is dependent on the particular sample taken from
  the population, there is variability in the estimated values relatively to those
  of the true population. In the present work we propose the use of a confidence interval
  (CI) to account for this variability when W is used. The CI analytical formula is
  derived assuming a Gaussian sampling distribution and recurring to the algebraic
  relationship between W and the Simpson's index of diversity. This relationship also
  allows the estimation of the expected Wallace value under the assumption of independence
  of classifications. We evaluated the CI performance using simulated and published
  microbial typing data sets. The simulations showed that the CI has the desired 95%
  coverage when the W is greater than 0.5. This behaviour is robust to changes in
  cluster number, cluster size distributions and sample size. The analysis of the
  published data sets demonstrated the usefulness of the new CI by objectively validating
  some of the previous interpretations, while showing that other conclusions lacked
  statistical support. Â© 2008 Pinto et al.
