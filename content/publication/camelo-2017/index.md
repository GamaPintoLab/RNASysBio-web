abstract: Copyright © 2017 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd. During exposure of yeast cells
  to low levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the expression of several genes is regulated
  for cells to adapt to the surrounding oxidative environment. Such adaptation involves
  modification of plasma membrane lipid composition, reorganization of ergosterol-rich
  microdomains and altered gene expression of proteins involved in lipid and vesicle
  traffic, to decrease permeability to exogenous H2O2. Opi1p is a transcriptional
  repressor that is inactive when present at the nuclear membrane/endoplasmic reticulum,
  but represseses transcription of inositol upstream activating sequence (UASINO)-containing
  genes, many of which are involved in the synthesis of phospholipids and fatty acids,
  when it is translocated to the nucleus. We investigated whether H2O2 in concentrations
  inducing adaptation regulates Opi1p function. We found that, in the presence of
  H2O2, GFP–Opi1p fusion protein translocates to the nucleus and, concomitantly, the
  expression of UASINO-containing genes is affected. We also investigated whether
  cysteine residues of Opi1p were implicated in the H2O2-mediated translocation of
  this protein to the nucleus and identified cysteine residue 159 as essential for
  this process. Our work shows that Opi1p is redox-regulated and establishes a new
  mechanism of gene regulation involving Opi1p, which is important for adaptation
  to H2O2 in yeast cells. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
