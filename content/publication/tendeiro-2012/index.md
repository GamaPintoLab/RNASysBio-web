abstract: "Objective: Hyper-immune activation is a main determinant of HIV disease\
  \ progression, potentially counter-acted by T-cell inhibitory pathways. Here we\
  \ investigated, for the first time, inhibitory molecules in HIV-2 infection, a naturally\
  \ occurring attenuated form of HIV disease, associated with reduced viremia and\
  \ very slow rates of CD4 T-cell decline. Design: Programmed death (PD)-1/PD-L1,\
  \ an important pathway in limiting immunopathology, and its possible relationship\
  \ with T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing molecule-3 (TIM-3), a recently\
  \ identified inhibitory molecule, were studied in untreated HIV-2 and HIV-1 cohorts,\
  \ matched for degree of CD4 T-cell depletion, and noninfected individuals. Methods:\
  \ Flow cytometric analysis of T-cell expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and TIM-3, combined\
  \ with markers of cell differentiation, activation, cycling and survival. Statistical\
  \ analysis was performed using ANOVA, Mann-Whitney/Wilcoxon tests, Spearman's correlations,\
  \ multiple linear regressions and canonical correlation analysis. Results: T-cell\
  \ expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was tightly associated and directly correlated with\
  \ CD4 T-cell depletion and immune activation in HIV-2 infection. No such correlation\
  \ was found for PD-L1 expression in HIV-1-positive patients. Central memory and\
  \ intermediate memory cells, rather than terminally differentiated T-cells, expressed\
  \ the highest levels of both PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules. Conversely, TIM-3 expression\
  \ was independent of T-cell differentiation and dissociated from cell cycling, suggesting\
  \ distinct induction mechanisms. Importantly, in contrast with HIV-1, no significant\
  \ increases in TIM-3 expression were found in the HIV-2 cohort. Conclusions: Our\
  \ data suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 molecules, rather than markers of T-cell exhaustion,\
  \ may act as modulators of T-cell immune activation, contributing to the slower\
  \ course of HIV-2 infection. These data have implications for the design of antiretroviral\
  \ therapy-complementary immune-based strategies. Â© 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health |\
