abstract: © 2016, American Society for Microbiology. Nasopharyngeal colonization is
  important for Streptococcus pneumoniae evolution, providing the opportunity for
  horizontal gene transfer when multiple strains co-occur. Although colonization with
  more than one strain of pneumococcus is common, the factors that influence the ability
  of strains to coexist are not known. A highly variable blp (bacteriocin-like peptide)
  locus has been identified in all sequenced strains of S. pneumoniae. This locus
  controls the regulation and secretion of bacteriocins, small peptides that target
  other bacteria. In this study, we analyzed a series of cocolonizing isolates to
  evaluate the impact of the blp locus on human colonization to determine whether
  competitive phenotypes of bacteriocin secretion restrict cocolonization. We identified
  a collection of 135 nasopharyngeal samples cocolonized with two or more strains,
  totaling 285 isolates. The blp locus of all strains was characterized genetically
  with regard to pheromone type, bacteriocin/immunity content, and potential for locus
  functionality. Inhibitory phenotypes of bacteriocin secretion and locus activity
  were assessed through overlay assays. Isolates from single colonizations (n=298)
  were characterized for comparison. Cocolonizing strains had a high diversity of
  blp cassettes; approximately one-third displayed an inhibitory phenotype in vitro.
  Despite in vitro evidence of competition, pneumococci cocolonized the subjects independently
  of blp pheromone type (P=0.577), bacteriocin/immunity content, blp locus activity
  (P=0.798), and inhibitory phenotype (P=0.716). In addition, no significant differences
  were observed when single and cocolonizing strains were compared. Despite clear
  evidence of blp-mediated competition in experimental models, the results of our
  study suggest that the blp locus plays a limited role in restricting pneumococcal
  cocolonization in humans.
