abstract: © 2016 Elsevier Ltd Introduction Pneumococcal multiple serotype carriage
  is important for evolution of the species and to understand how the pneumococcal
  population is changing with vaccination. We aimed to determine the impact of the
  13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) on multiple serotype carriage.
  Methods and materials Nasopharyngeal samples from fully vaccinated pneumococcal
  carriers (4 doses of PCV13, n = 141, aged 18–72 months) or from non-vaccinated pneumococcal
  carriers (0 doses of any PCV, n = 140, same age group) were analyzed. Multiple serotype
  carriage was evaluated by DNA hybridization with a molecular serotyping microarray
  that detects all known serotypes. Results Vaccinated children had a lower prevalence
  of multiple serotype carriage than the non-vaccinated group (20.6% vs 29.3%, p = 0.097),
  and a significantly lower proportion of PCV13 serotypes (6.4% vs 38.5%, p = 0.0001).
  PCV13 serotypes found among vaccinated children were mostly detected as a minor
  serotype in co-colonization with a more abundant non-vaccine serotype. Vaccinated
  children were colonized by a significantly higher proportion of commensal non-pneumococcal
  Streptococcus spp. (58.2% vs 42.8%, p = 0.012). In vaccinated children there were
  significantly less non-vaccine type (NVT) co-colonization events than expected based
  on the distribution of these serotypes in non-vaccinated children. Conclusions The
  results suggest that vaccinated children have lower pneumococcal multiple serotype
  carriage prevalence due to higher competitive abilities of non-vaccine serotypes
  expanding after PCV13 use. This might represent an additional benefit of PCV13,
  as decreased co-colonization rates translate into decreased opportunities for horizontal
  gene transfer and might have implications for the evolution and virulence of pneumococci.
