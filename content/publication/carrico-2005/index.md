abstract: Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been the typing method of choice
  for strain identification in epidemiological studies of several bacterial species
  of medical importance. The usual procedure for the comparison of strains and assignment
  of strain type and subtype relies on visual assessment of band difference number,
  followed by an incremental assignment to the group hosting the most similar type
  previously seen. Band-based similarity coefficients, such as the Dice or the Jaccard
  coefficient, are then used for dendrogram construction, which provides a quantitative
  assessment of strain similarity. PFGE type assignment is based on the definition
  of a threshold linkage value, below which strains are assigned to the same group.
  This is typically performed empirically by inspecting the hierarchical cluster analysis
  dendrogram containing the strains of interest. This approach has the problem that
  the threshold value selected is dependent on the linkage method used for dendrogram
  construction. Furthermore, the use of a linkage method skews the original similarity
  values between strains. In this paper we assess the goodness of classification of
  several band-based similarity coefficients by comparing it with the band difference
  number for PFGE type and subtype classification using receiver operating characteristic
  curves. The procedure described was applied to a collection of PFGE results for
  1,798 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which documented 96 types and 396 subtypes.
  The band-based similarity coefficients were found to perform equally well for type
  classification, but with different proportions of false-positive and false-negative
  classifications in their minimal false discovery rate when they were used for subtype
  classification. Copyright © 2005, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights
