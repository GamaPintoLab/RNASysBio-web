The lung epithelium is lined with a layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) that is crucial for healthy lung function. ASL thickness is controlled by two ion channels: epithelium sodium channel (ENaC) and cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Here, we present a minimal mathematical model of ENaC, CFTR and ASL regulation that sheds light on the control of ENaC by the short palate lung and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) protein and by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). The model, despite its simplicity, yields a good fit to experimental observations and is an effective tool for exploring the interplay between ENaC, CFTR and ASL. Steady-state data and dynamic information constrain the model’s parameters without ambiguities. Testing the hypothesis that PI(4,5)P2 protects ENaC from ubiquitination suggests that this protection does not improve the model results and that the control of the ENaC opening probability by PI(4,5)P2 is sufficient to explain all available data. The model analysis further demonstrates that ASL at the steady state is sensitive to small changes in PI(4,5)P2 abundance, particularly in CF conditions, which suggests that manipulation of phosphoinositide metabolism may promote therapeutic benefits for CF patients.},
