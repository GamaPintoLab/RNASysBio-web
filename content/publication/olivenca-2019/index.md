  The lung epithelium is lined with a layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) that is
  crucial for healthy lung function. ASL thickness is controlled by two ion channels:
  epithelium sodium channel (ENaC) and cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR). Here, we present a minimal mathematical model of ENaC, CFTR and
  ASL regulation that sheds light on the control of ENaC by the short palate lung
  and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) protein and by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate
  (PI(4,5)P2). The model, despite its simplicity, yields a good fit to experimental
  observations and is an effective tool for exploring the interplay between ENaC,
  CFTR and ASL. Steady-state data and dynamic information constrain the model’s parameters
  without ambiguities. Testing the hypothesis that PI(4,5)P2 protects ENaC from ubiquitination
  suggests that this protection does not improve the model results and that the control
  of the ENaC opening probability by PI(4,5)P2 is sufficient to explain all available
  data. The model analysis further demonstrates that ASL at the steady state is sensitive
  to small changes in PI(4,5)P2 abundance, particularly in CF conditions, which suggests
  that manipulation of phosphoinositide metabolism may promote therapeutic benefits
  for CF patients.'
