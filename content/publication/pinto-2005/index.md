abstract: 'Motivation: Integrated analysis of expression data and gene ontology annotations
  is a prime example of biological data that need co-explanatory interpretation. This
  particular application is used to validate a new method for integrated analysis
  of varied biological information. Results: The proposed method consists of determining
  local correlation coefficients and the corresponding P-values calculated per biological
  entity. This measure considers the combined intensity and significance of the agreement
  or disagreement, between two data sources about the same biological entity. The
  method is applied to the integrated analysis of gene expression and annotation of
  two gene sets, one from yeast and other from mouse. The potential of the method
  to generate accurate mechanistic hypothesis is also demonstrated. Specially, negative
  correlation results pose a new kind of biological hypothesis. Method performance
  was compared with annotation enrichment methods, and optimal conditions for the
  superiority of local correlation results are discussed. Â© The Author 2004. Published
