Master’s student in Medical Biochemistry with a BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics. Enthusiastic about science from an early age, I developed great interest in the genetic and immunological fields upon the course of my studies. I'm currently doing my master's dissertation in RNA Systems Biology Lab, inserted in the BioISI institute of FCUL (Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa). My thesis theme is entitled "Regulation of viral and host genes by novel candidate HIV microRNAs", supervised by professor Margarida Gama-Carvalho, PhD. 
Wishful for the upcoming challenges and opportunities to develop my knowledge and experience in this field, as well as to contribute to the growing scientific.
