Cláudia is currently studying the role of miR-34c-5p in the Immune System and its impact in HIV-1 infection. 
She really likes to design and overplan her experiments to make the most challenging experimental setups look easypeasy. 
During her free time she loves to play and watch football, wike with her dog and go to the beach. Cláudia is usually in a good mood. If not, just offer her food and you'll be safe.
Green flags: Knows where everything in the lab is, problem-solver, helps everyone, opens every stuck schott flasks.
Red flags: Hides her dirty lab dishes, messy desk.
