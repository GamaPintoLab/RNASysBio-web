I'm a Molecular Systems Biologist currently based in Lisbon, Portugal collaborating at BioISI (Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon). I'm currently trying to deepen my knowledge of cutting-edge genomics approaches, such as RNA-Seq. I enjoy mixing together wet and computational approaches to gain a better understanding of complex biological systems, and discovering novel approaches for tackling grave diseases.
