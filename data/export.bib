   abstract = {<p>U2AF65 is an essential splicing factor that promotes binding of U2 small nuclear (sn)RNP at the pre-mRNA branchpoint. Here we describe a novel monoclonal antibody that reacts specifically with U2AF65. Using this antibody, we show that U2AF65 is diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm with additional concentration in nuclear speckles, which represent subnuclear compartments enriched in splicing snRNPs and other splicing factors. Furthermore, transient expression assays using epitope-tagged deletion mutants of U2AF65 indicate that targeting of the protein to nuclear speckles is not affected by removing either the RNA binding domain, the RS domain, or the region required for interaction with U2AF35. The association of U2AF65 with speckles persists during mitosis, when transcription and splicing are downregulated. Moreover, U2AF65 is localized to nuclear speckles in early G1 cells that were treated with transcription inhibitors during mitosis, suggesting that the localization of U2AF65 in speckles is independent of the presence of pre-mRNA in the nucleus, which is consistent with the idea that speckles represent storage sites for inactive splicing factors. After adenovirus infection, U2AF65 redistributes from the speckles and is prefferentially detected at sites of viral transcription. By combining adenoviral infection with transient expression of deletion mutants, we show a specific requirement of the RS domain for recruitment of U2AF65 to sites of active splicing in the nucleus. This suggests that interactions involving the RS region of U2AF65 may play an important role in targeting this protein to spliceosomes in vivo.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The premessenger RNA of the majority of human genes can generate various transcripts through alternative splicing, and different tissues or disease states show specific patterns of splicing variants. These patterns depend on the relative concentrations of the splicing factors present in the cell nucleus, either as a consequence of their expression levels or of post-translational modifications, such as protein phosphorylation, which are determined by signal transduction pathways. Here, we analyzed the contribution of protein kinases to the regulation of alternative splicing variant Rac1b that is overexpressed in certain tumor types. In colorectal cells, we found that depletion of AKT2, AKT3, GSK3β, and SRPK1 significantly decreased endogenous Rac1b levels. Although knockdown of AKT2 and AKT3 affected only Rac1b protein levels suggesting a post-splicing effect, the depletion of GSK3β or SRPK1 decreased Rac1b alternative splicing, an effect mediated through changes in splicing factor SRSF1. In particular, the knockdown of SRPK1 or inhibition of its catalytic activity reduced phosphorylation and subsequent translocation of SRSF1 to the nucleus, limiting its availability to promote the inclusion of alternative exon 3b into the Rac1 pre-mRNA. Altogether, the data identify SRSF1 as a prime regulator of Rac1b expression in colorectal cells and provide further mechanistic insight into how the regulation of alternative splicing events by protein kinases can contribute to sustain tumor cell survival.</p>},

Tandemly repeated satellite DNAs (satDNAs) can be found clustered in specific heterochromatin-rich chromosomal regions, building vital structures like functional centromeres and also dispersed within euchromatin. Interestingly, despite their association to critical chromosomal structures, satDNAs are widely variable among species due to their high turnover rates. This dynamic behavior has been associated with genome plasticity and chromosome rearrangements, leading to the reshaping of genomes. Here we present the current knowledge regarding satDNAs in the light of new genomic technologies, and the challenges in the study of these sequences. Furthermore, we discuss how these sequences, together with other repeats, influence genome architecture, impacting its evolution and association with disease.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Familial hypercholesterolaemia increases circulating LDL-C levels and leads to premature cardiovascular disease when undiagnosed or untreated. Current guidelines support genetic testing in patients complying with clinical diagnostic criteria and cascade screening of their family members. However, most of hyperlipidaemic subjects do not present pathogenic variants in the known disease genes, and most likely suffer from polygenic hypercholesterolaemia, which translates into a relatively low yield of genetic screening programs. This study aims to identify new biomarkers and develop new approaches to improve the identification of individuals carrying monogenic causative variants. Using a machine-learning approach in a paediatric dataset of individuals, tested for disease causative genes and with an extended lipid profile, we developed new models able to classify familial hypercholesterolaemia patients with a much higher specificity than currently used methods. The best performing models incorporated parameters absent from the most common FH clinical criteria, namely apoB/apoA-I, TG/apoB and LDL1. These parameters were found to contribute to an improved identification of monogenic individuals. Furthermore, models using only TC and LDL-C levels presented a higher specificity of classification when compared to simple cut-offs. Our results can be applied towards the improvement of the yield of genetic screening programs and corresponding costs.</p>},

Host macrophages, essential to the first-line defence mechanisms, are quickly restricted in their ability to initiate a classic protective pro-inflammatory immune response. We found that macrophages from infected animals are enriched with parasite-derived micro(mi)RNAs. The most abundant of these miRNAs, <italic>fhe-miR-125b</italic> , is released by the parasite via exosomes and is homologous to a mammalian miRNA, <italic>hsa-miR-125b</italic> , that is known to regulate the activation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages.

SatDNA sequences can vary on a large number of features, including nucleotide composition, complexity, and abundance. Several satDNA families have been identified and characterized in the human genome through time, albeit at different speeds. Human satDNA families present a high degree of sub-variability, leading to the definition of various subfamilies with different organization and clustered localization. Evolution of satDNA analysis has enabled the progressive characterization of satDNA features. Despite recent advances in the sequencing of centromeric arrays, comprehensive genomic studies to assess their variability are still required to provide accurate and proportional representation of satDNA (peri)centromeric/acrocentric short arm sequences. Approaches combining multiple techniques have been successfully applied and seem to be the path to follow for generating integrated knowledge in the promising field of human satDNA biology.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial regulators of cellular processes, including metabolism. Attempts to use miRNAs as therapeutic agents are being explored in several areas, including the control of cancer progression. Recent evidence suggests fine tuning miRNA activity to reprogram tumor cell metabolism has enormous potential as an alternative treatment option. Indeed, cancer growth is known to be linked to profound metabolic changes. Likewise, the emerging field of immunometabolism is leading to a refined understanding of how immune cell proliferation and function is governed by glucose homeostasis. Different immune cell types are now known to have unique metabolic signatures that switch in response to a changing environment. T-cell subsets exhibit distinct metabolic profiles which underlie their alternative differentiation and phenotypic functions. Recent evidence shows that the susceptibility of CD4+ T-cells to HIV infection is intimately linked to their metabolic activity, with many of the metabolic features of HIV-1-infected cells resembling those found in tumor cells. In this review, we discuss the use of miRNA modulation to achieve metabolic reprogramming for cancer therapy and explore the idea that the same approach may serve as an effective mechanism to restrict HIV replication and eliminate infected cells.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play a key role in regulating gene expression. These molecules exert their function through sequence complementarity with microRNA responsive elements and are typically located in the 3′ untranslated region of mRNAs, negatively regulating expression. Even though the relevant role of miRNA-dependent regulation is broadly recognized, the principles governing their ability to lead to specific functional outcomes in distinct cell types are still not well understood. In recent years, an intriguing hypothesis proposed that miRNA-responsive elements act as communication links between different RNA species, making the investigation of microRNA function even more complex than previously thought. The competing endogenous RNA hypothesis suggests the presence of a new level of regulation, whereby a specific RNA transcript can indirectly influence the abundance of other transcripts by limiting the availability of a common miRNA, acting as a “molecular sponge”. Since this idea has been proposed, several studies have tried to pinpoint the interaction networks that have been established between different RNA species and whether they contribute to normal cell function and disease. The focus of this review is to highlight recent developments and achievements made towards the process of characterizing competing endogenous RNA networks and their role in cellular function.</p>},

Cyclic AMP regulates both CFTR channel gating through a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent process and plasma membane (PM) stability through activation of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP1 (EPAC1). This cAMP effector, when activated promotes the NHERF1:CFTR interaction leading to an increase in CFTR at the PM by decreasing its endocytosis. Here, we used protein interaction profiling and bioinformatic analysis to identify proteins that interact with CFTR under EPAC1 activation as possible regulators of this CFTR PM anchoring. We identified an enrichment in cytoskeleton related proteins among which we characterized CAPZA2 and INF2 as regulators of CFTR trafficking to the PM. We found that CAPZA2 promotes wt-CFTR trafficking under EPAC1 activation at the PM whereas reduction of INF2 levels leads to a similar trafficking promotion effect. These results suggest that CAPZA2 is a positive regulator and INF2 a negative one for the increase of CFTR at the PM after an increase of cAMP and concomitant EPAC1 activation. Identifying the specific interactions involving CFTR and elicited by EPAC1 activation provides novel insights into late CFTR trafficking, insertion and/or stabilization at the PM and highlighs new potential therapeutic targets to tackle CF disease.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Cystic fibrosis is a condition caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). It is also thought to increase the activity of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). The altered function of these ion channels is one of the causes of the thick dehydrated mucus that characterizes the disease and is partially responsible for recurrent pulmonary infections and inflammation events that ultimately destroy the lungs of affected subjects. Phosphoinositides are signaling lipids that regulate numerous cellular processes and membrane proteins, including ENaC. Inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), an enzyme of the phosphoinositide pathway, reduces ENaC function. We propose a computational analysis that is based on the combination of two existing mathematical models: one representing the dynamics of phosphoinositides and the other explaining how phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P <sub>2</sub> ) influences ENaC activity and, consequently, airway surface liquid. This integrated model permits, for the first time, a detailed assessment of the intricate interactions between DGK and ENaC and is consistent with available literature data. In particular, the computational approach allows comparisons of two competing hypotheses regarding the regulation of ENaC. The results strongly suggest that the regulation of ENaC is primarily exerted through the control of PI(4,5)P <sub>2</sub> production by type-I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5KI), which in turn is controlled by phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of the DGK reaction. </p>},

Although the majority of the lineages are associated with humans, at least four lineages are adapted to other mammals, including different M. tuberculosis ecotypes. Host specificity is associated with higher virulence in its preferred host in ecotypes such as M. bovis. Deciphering what determines the preference of the host can reveal host-specific virulence patterns. However, it is not clear which genomic determinants might be influencing host specificity. In this study, we apply a combination of unsupervised and supervised classification methods on genomic data of ~27,000 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates to decipher host-specific genomic determinants. Host-specific genomic signatures are scarce beyond known lineage-specific mutations. Therefore, we integrated lineage-specific mutations into the iEK1011 2.0 genome-scale metabolic model to obtain lineage-specific versions of it. Flux distributions sampled from the solution spaces of these models can be accurately separated according to host association. This separation correlated with differences in cell wall processes, lipid, amino acid and carbon metabolic subsystems. These differences were observable when more than 95% of the samples had a specific growth rate significantly lower than the maximum achievable by the models. This suggests that these differences might manifest at low growth rate settings, such as the restrictive conditions M. tuberculosis suffers during macrophage infection.</p>},

Here we investigated the biosurfactants that the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> makes and secretes to decrease the surface tension of surrounding liquid. Using a combination of genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and mathematical modeling we show that the ability to make surfactants from glycerol varies inconsistently across the phylogenetic tree; instead, lineages that lost this ability are also worse at reducing the oxidative stress of primary metabolism on glycerol. Experiments with different carbon sources support a link with oxidative stress that explains the inconsistent distribution across the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> phylogeny and suggests a general principle: <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lineages produce surfactants if they can reduce the oxidative stress produced by primary metabolism and have excess resources, beyond their primary needs, to afford secondary metabolism.

   abstract = {Protein misfolding disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson and transthyretin amyloidosis are characterized by the formation of protein amyloid deposits. Although the nature and location of the aggregated proteins varies between different diseases, they all share similar molecular pathways of protein unfolding, aggregation and amyloid deposition. Most effects of these proteins are likely to occur at the proteome level, a virtually unexplored reality. To investigate the effects of an amyloid protein expression on the cellular proteome, we created a yeast expression system using human transthyretin (TTR) as a model amyloidogenic protein. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a living test tube, to express native TTR (non-amyloidogenic) and the amyloidogenic TTR variant L55P, the later forming aggregates when expressed in yeast. Differential proteome changes were quantitatively analyzed by 2D-differential in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). We show that the expression of the amyloidogenic TTR-L55P causes a metabolic shift towards energy production, increased superoxide dismutase expression as well as of several molecular chaperones involved in protein refolding. Among these chaperones, members of the HSP70 family and the peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) were identified. The latter is highly relevant considering that it was previously found to be a TTR interacting partner in the plasma of ATTR patients but not in healthy or asymptomatic subjects. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) expression is also increased. Our findings suggest that refolding and degradation pathways are activated, causing an increased demand of energetic resources, thus the metabolic shift. Additionally, oxidative stress appears to be a consequence of the amyloidogenic process, posing an enhanced threat to cell survival. © 2012 Gomes et al.},

Isolates were serotyped and genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and a selection of isolates were also characterized by multilocus sequence typing. We found that the diversities of serotypes and genotypes of pneumococci responsible for invasive infections and carriage were identical and that most carried clones could also be detected as causes of invasive disease. Their ability to do so, however, varied substantially. Serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7F, 8, 9N, 9L, 12B, 14, 18C, and 20 were found to have an enhanced propensity to cause invasive disease, while serotypes 6A, 6B, 11A, 15B/C, 16F, 19F, 23F, 34, 35F, and 37 were associated with carriage. In addition, significant differences in invasive disease potential between clones sharing the same serotype were found among several serotypes, namely, 3, 6A, 6B, 11A, 14, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, 34, and NT. This heterogeneous behavior of the clones was found irrespective of the serotype's overall invasive disease potential. Our results highlight the importance of the genetic background when analyzing the invasive disease potential of certain serotypes and provide an important baseline for its monitoring following conjugate vaccine use. Continuous surveillance should be maintained, and current research should focus on uncovering the genetic determinants that contribute to the heterogeneity of invasive disease potential of clones sharing the same serotype.

   abstract = {Objective: Hyper-immune activation is a main determinant of HIV disease progression, potentially counter-acted by T-cell inhibitory pathways. Here we investigated, for the first time, inhibitory molecules in HIV-2 infection, a naturally occurring attenuated form of HIV disease, associated with reduced viremia and very slow rates of CD4 T-cell decline. Design: Programmed death (PD)-1/PD-L1, an important pathway in limiting immunopathology, and its possible relationship with T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing molecule-3 (TIM-3), a recently identified inhibitory molecule, were studied in untreated HIV-2 and HIV-1 cohorts, matched for degree of CD4 T-cell depletion, and noninfected individuals. Methods: Flow cytometric analysis of T-cell expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and TIM-3, combined with markers of cell differentiation, activation, cycling and survival. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, Mann-Whitney/Wilcoxon tests, Spearman's correlations, multiple linear regressions and canonical correlation analysis. Results: T-cell expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was tightly associated and directly correlated with CD4 T-cell depletion and immune activation in HIV-2 infection. No such correlation was found for PD-L1 expression in HIV-1-positive patients. Central memory and intermediate memory cells, rather than terminally differentiated T-cells, expressed the highest levels of both PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules. Conversely, TIM-3 expression was independent of T-cell differentiation and dissociated from cell cycling, suggesting distinct induction mechanisms. Importantly, in contrast with HIV-1, no significant increases in TIM-3 expression were found in the HIV-2 cohort. Conclusions: Our data suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 molecules, rather than markers of T-cell exhaustion, may act as modulators of T-cell immune activation, contributing to the slower course of HIV-2 infection. These data have implications for the design of antiretroviral therapy-complementary immune-based strategies. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

   abstract = {Recent findings have shown that the blood vessels of different organs exert an active role in regulating organ function. In detail, the endothelium that aligns the vasculature of most organs is fundamental in maintaining organ homeostasis and in promoting organ recovery following injury. Mechanistically, endothelial cells (EC) of tissues such as the liver, lungs or the bone marrow (BM) have been shown to produce "angiocrine" factors that promote organ recovery and restore normal organ function. Controlled production of angiocrine factors following organ injury is therefore essential to promote organ regeneration and to restore organ function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated production and function of such "angiocrine" factors are largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present study. In detail, we identified for the first time a microRNA (miRNA) expressed by BM EC that regulates the expression of angiocrine genes involved in BM recovery following irradiation. Using a microarray-based approach, we identified several miRNA expressed by irradiated BMEC. After validating the variations in miRNA expression by semi-quantitative PCR, we chose to study further the ones showing consistent variations between experiments, and those predicted to regulate (directly or indirectly) angiogenic and angiocrine factors. Of the mi-RNA that were chosen, miR-363-5p (previously termed miR-363*) was subsequently shown to modulate the expression of numerous EC-specific genes including some angiocrine factors. By luciferase reporter assays, miR-363-5p is shown to regulate the expression of angiocrine factors tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (Timp-1) and thrombospondin 3 (THBS3) at post-transcriptional level. Moreover, miR-363-5p reduction using anti-miR is shown to affect EC angiogenic properties (such as the response to angiogenic factors stimulation) and the interaction between EC and hematopoietic precursors (particularly relevant in a BM setting). miR-363-5p reduction resulted in a significant decrease in EC tube formation on matrigel, but increased hematopoietic precursor cells adhesion onto EC, a mechanism that is shown to involve kit ligand-mediated cell adhesion. Taken together, we have identified a miRNA induced by irradiation that regulates angiocrine factors expression on EC and as such modulates EC properties. Further studies on the importance of miR-363-5p on normal BM function and in disease are warranted. © 2013 Costa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Nasopharyngeal colonization is important for Streptococcus pneumoniae evolution, providing the opportunity for horizontal gene transfer when multiple strains co-occur. Although colonization with more than one strain of pneumococcus is common, the factors that influence the ability of strains to coexist are not known. A highly variable blp (bacteriocin-like peptide) locus has been identified in all sequenced strains of S. pneumoniae. This locus controls the regulation and secretion of bacteriocins, small peptides that target other bacteria. In this study, we analyzed a series of cocolonizing isolates to evaluate the impact of the blp locus on human colonization to determine whether competitive phenotypes of bacteriocin secretion restrict cocolonization. We identified a collection of 135 nasopharyngeal samples cocolonized with two or more strains, totaling 285 isolates. The blp locus of all strains was characterized genetically with regard to pheromone type, bacteriocin/immunity content, and potential for locus functionality. Inhibitory phenotypes of bacteriocin secretion and locus activity were assessed through overlay assays. Isolates from single colonizations (n=298) were characterized for comparison. Cocolonizing strains had a high diversity of blp cassettes; approximately one-third displayed an inhibitory phenotype in vitro. Despite in vitro evidence of competition, pneumococci cocolonized the subjects independently of blp pheromone type (P=0.577), bacteriocin/immunity content, blp locus activity (P=0.798), and inhibitory phenotype (P=0.716). In addition, no significant differences were observed when single and cocolonizing strains were compared. Despite clear evidence of blp-mediated competition in experimental models, the results of our study suggest that the blp locus plays a limited role in restricting pneumococcal cocolonization in humans.},

   abstract = {Copyright © 2017 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd. During exposure of yeast cells to low levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the expression of several genes is regulated for cells to adapt to the surrounding oxidative environment. Such adaptation involves modification of plasma membrane lipid composition, reorganization of ergosterol-rich microdomains and altered gene expression of proteins involved in lipid and vesicle traffic, to decrease permeability to exogenous H2O2. Opi1p is a transcriptional repressor that is inactive when present at the nuclear membrane/endoplasmic reticulum, but represseses transcription of inositol upstream activating sequence (UASINO)-containing genes, many of which are involved in the synthesis of phospholipids and fatty acids, when it is translocated to the nucleus. We investigated whether H2O2 in concentrations inducing adaptation regulates Opi1p function. We found that, in the presence of H2O2, GFP–Opi1p fusion protein translocates to the nucleus and, concomitantly, the expression of UASINO-containing genes is affected. We also investigated whether cysteine residues of Opi1p were implicated in the H2O2-mediated translocation of this protein to the nucleus and identified cysteine residue 159 as essential for this process. Our work shows that Opi1p is redox-regulated and establishes a new mechanism of gene regulation involving Opi1p, which is important for adaptation to H2O2 in yeast cells.

   abstract = {Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been the typing method of choice for strain identification in epidemiological studies of several bacterial species of medical importance. The usual procedure for the comparison of strains and assignment of strain type and subtype relies on visual assessment of band difference number, followed by an incremental assignment to the group hosting the most similar type previously seen. Band-based similarity coefficients, such as the Dice or the Jaccard coefficient, are then used for dendrogram construction, which provides a quantitative assessment of strain similarity. PFGE type assignment is based on the definition of a threshold linkage value, below which strains are assigned to the same group. This is typically performed empirically by inspecting the hierarchical cluster analysis dendrogram containing the strains of interest. This approach has the problem that the threshold value selected is dependent on the linkage method used for dendrogram construction. Furthermore, the use of a linkage method skews the original similarity values between strains. In this paper we assess the goodness of classification of several band-based similarity coefficients by comparing it with the band difference number for PFGE type and subtype classification using receiver operating characteristic curves. The procedure described was applied to a collection of PFGE results for 1,798 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which documented 96 types and 396 subtypes. The band-based similarity coefficients were found to perform equally well for type classification, but with different proportions of false-positive and false-negative classifications in their minimal false discovery rate when they were used for subtype classification.

In this study we aimed to evaluate the impact of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) on pneumococcal co-colonization among Portuguese children. Nasopharyngeal samples from children up to 6 years old yielding a pneumococcal culture were clustered into three groups: pre-vaccine era (n = 173), unvaccinated children of the vaccine era (n = 169), and fully vaccinated children (4 doses; n = 150). Co-colonization, serotype identification, and relative serotype abundance were detected by analysis of DNA of the total bacterial growth of the primary culture plate using the plyNCR-RFLP method and a molecular serotyping microarray-based strategy. The plyNCR-RFLP method detected an overall co-colonization rate of 20.1%. Microarray analysis confirmed the plyNCR-RFLP results. Vaccination status was the only factor found to be significantly associated with co-colonization: co-colonization rates were significantly lower (p = 0.004; Fisher's exact test) among fully vaccinated children (8.0%) than among children from the pre-PCV7 era (17.3%) or unvaccinated children of the PCV7 era (18.3%). In the PCV7 era there were significantly less non-vaccine type (NVT) co-colonization events than would be expected based on the NVT distribution observed in the pre-PCV7 era (p = 0.024). In conclusion, vaccination with PCV7 resulted in a lower co-colonization rate due to an asymmetric distribution between NVTs found in single and co-colonized samples. We propose that some NVTs prevalent in the PCV7 era are more competitive than others, hampering their co-existence in the same niche. This result may have important implications since a decrease in co-colonization events is expected to translate in decreased opportunities for horizontal gene transfer, hindering pneumococcal evolution events such as acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants or capsular switch. This might represent a novel potential benefit of conjugate vaccines. © 2012 Valente et al.},

   abstract = {© 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry In this review, we present our most recent understanding of key biomolecular processes that underlie two motor neuron degenerative disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. We focus on the role of four multifunctional proteins involved in RNA metabolism (TDP-43, FUS, SMN, and Senataxin) that play a causal role in these diseases. Recent results have led to a novel scenario of intricate connections between these four proteins, bringing transcriptome homeostasis into the spotlight as a common theme in motor neuron degeneration. We review reported functional and physical interactions between these four proteins, highlighting their common association with nuclear bodies and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle biogenesis and function. We discuss how these interactions are turning out to be particularly relevant for the control of transcription and chromatin homeostasis, including the recent identification of an association between SMN and Senataxin required to ensure the resolution of DNA-RNA hybrid formation and proper termination by RNA polymerase II. These connections strongly support the existence of common pathways underlying the spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotype. We also discuss the potential of genome-wide expression profiling, in particular RNA sequencing derived data, to contribute to unravelling the underlying mechanisms. We provide a review of publicly available datasets that have addressed both diseases using these approaches, and highlight the value of investing in cross-disease studies to promote our understanding of the pathways leading to neurodegeneration.

   abstract = {The studies that correlate the results obtained by different typing methodologies rely solely on qualitative comparisons of the groups defined by each methodology. We propose a framework of measures for the quantitative assessment of correspondences between different typing methods as a first step to the global mapping of type equivalences. A collection of 325 macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes isolates associated with pharyngitis cases in Portugal was used to benchmark the proposed measures. All isolates were characterized by macrolide resistance phenotyping, T serotyping, emm sequence typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), using SmaI or Cfr9I and SfiI. A subset of 41 isolates, representing each PFGE cluster, was also characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The application of Adjusted Rand and Wallace indices allowed the evaluation of the strength and the directionality of the correspondences between the various typing methods and showed that if PFGE or MLST data are available one can confidently predict the emm type (Wallace coefficients of 0.952 for both methods). In contrast, emm typing was a poor predictor of PFGE cluster or MLST sequence type (Wallace coefficients of 0.803 and 0.655, respectively). This was confirmed by the analysis of the larger data set available from http://spyogenes.mlst.net and underscores the necessity of performing PFGE or MLST to unambiguously define clones in S. pyogenes.

In cystic fibrosis, the most common disease-causing mutation is F508del, which causes not only intracellular retention and degradation of CFTR, but also defective channel gating and decreased membrane stability of the small amount that reaches the plasma membrane (PM). Thus, pharmacological correction of mutant CFTR requires targeting of multiple cellular defects in order to achieve clinical benefit. Although small-molecule compounds have been identified and commercialized that can correct its folding or gating, an efficient retention of F508del CFTR at the PM has not yet been explored pharmacologically despite being recognized as a crucial factor for improving functional rescue of chloride transport. In ongoing efforts to determine the CFTR interactome at the PM, we used three complementary approaches: targeting proteins binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated CFTR, protein complexes involved in cAMP-mediated CFTR stabilization at the PM, and proteins selectively interacting at the PM with rescued F508del-CFTR but not wt-CFTR. Using co-immunoprecipitation or peptide–pull down strategies, we identified around 400 candidate proteins through sequencing of complex protein mixtures using the nano-LC Triple TOF MS technique. Key candidate proteins were validated for their robust interaction with CFTR-containing protein complexes and for their ability to modulate the amount of CFTR expressed at the cell surface of bronchial epithelial cells. Here, we describe how we explored the abovementioned experimental datasets to build a protein interaction network with the aim of identifying novel pharmacological targets to rescue CFTR function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We identified and validated novel candidate proteins that were essential components of the network but not detected in previous proteomic analyses.},

We, therefore, sought to determine the generalized involvement of sphingolipids in the heat stress response by using microarray hybridization of RNA isolated from heat-stressed cultures of the mutant strain lcb1-100, which is unable to produce sphingolipids in response to heat. Approximately 70 genes showed differential regulation during the first 15 min of heat stress in the lcb1-100 strain compared with the wild type strain, indicating a requirement for de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis for proper regulation of these genes during heat stress. Grouping these genes into functional categories revealed several pathways, including some in which sphingolipids were previously suspected to play a role, such as stress response pathways and cell cycle regulation. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed sphingolipid involvement in regulation of tRNA synthesis and metabolic genes and transporters. Additionally, the microarray results demonstrated novel sphingolipid involvement in transcriptional regulation of pathways of translation and cell wall organization and biogenesis. Our results demonstrate a broad-reaching effect of sphingolipids in the yeast heat stress response and suggest that the mechanism of sphingolipid involvement in several cellular pathways occurs via sphingolipid-mediated regulation of message levels.},

To identify pathways involved in cell death of the rd/rd rods, we evaluated gene expression in the rd/rd and wild type (wt) mouse retina (U74A oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix)) over the known time course of photoreceptor degeneration. 181 genes passed the selection criteria (low standard deviation and high correlation between replicates), falling into six clusters. For any given pair of genes, an expression profile correlation distance and a semantic distance (one for each class of gene ontology terms) were established using newly designed software. Gene expression in rd/rd started to deviate from wt by postnatal day 10. The reduction in photoreceptor-specific genes followed the known time course of photoreceptor degeneration. Likewise the increase in transcription factors and apoptosis- and neuroinflammation- specific genes followed the kinetics of the rise in intracellular cGMP in the rod photoreceptors. In addition, genes coding for calcium-binding proteins and those implicated in tissue and vessel remodeling were increased. These results suggest that photoreceptor degeneration in the rd/rd mouse is a process starting with Ca2+ toxicity followed by secondary insults involving multidestructive pathways such as apoptosis and neuroinflammation, presumably boosting morphological changes. All of these components need to be addressed if rods are to be successfully protected.},

We aimed to determine the impact of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) on multiple serotype carriage. Methods and materials Nasopharyngeal samples from fully vaccinated pneumococcal carriers (4 doses of PCV13, n = 141, aged 18–72 months) or from non-vaccinated pneumococcal carriers (0 doses of any PCV, n = 140, same age group) were analyzed. Multiple serotype carriage was evaluated by DNA hybridization with a molecular serotyping microarray that detects all known serotypes. Results Vaccinated children had a lower prevalence of multiple serotype carriage than the non-vaccinated group (20.6% vs 29.3%, p = 0.097), and a significantly lower proportion of PCV13 serotypes (6.4% vs 38.5%, p = 0.0001). PCV13 serotypes found among vaccinated children were mostly detected as a minor serotype in co-colonization with a more abundant non-vaccine serotype. Vaccinated children were colonized by a significantly higher proportion of commensal non-pneumococcal Streptococcus spp. (58.2% vs 42.8%, p = 0.012). In vaccinated children there were significantly less non-vaccine type (NVT) co-colonization events than expected based on the distribution of these serotypes in non-vaccinated children. Conclusions The results suggest that vaccinated children have lower pneumococcal multiple serotype carriage prevalence due to higher competitive abilities of non-vaccine serotypes expanding after PCV13 use. This might represent an additional benefit of PCV13, as decreased co-colonization rates translate into decreased opportunities for horizontal gene transfer and might have implications for the evolution and virulence of pneumococci.},

   abstract = {© 2018 The Author(s). Phosphoinositides are signalling lipids that constitute a complex network regulating many cellular processes. We propose a computational model that accounts for all species of phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. The model replicates the steady-state of the pathway and most known dynamic phenomena. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates model robustness to alterations in the parameters. Model analysis suggest that the greatest contributor to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) production is a flux representing the direct transformation of PI into PI(4,5)P2, also responsible for the maintenance of this pool when phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) is decreased. PI(5)P is also shown to be a significant source for PI(4,5)P2 production. The model was validated with siRNA screens that knocked down the expression of enzymes in the pathway. The screen monitored the activity of the epithelium sodium channel (ENaC), which is activated by PI(4,5)P2. While the model may deepen our understanding of other physiological processes involving phosphoinositides, we highlight therapeutic effects of ENaC modulation in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The model suggests control strategies where the activities of the enzyme phosphoinositide 4-phosphate 5-kinase I (PIP5KI) or the PI4K + PIP5KI + DVL protein complex are decreased and cause an efficacious reduction in PI(4,5)P2 levels while avoiding undesirable alterations in other phosphoinositide pools.},

   abstract = {© 2019 Matos et al. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel normally expressed at the surface of epithelial cells. The most frequent mutation, resulting in Phe-508 deletion, causes CFTR misfolding and its premature degradation. Low temperature or pharmacological correctors can partly rescue the Phe508del-CFTR processing defect and enhance trafficking of this channel variant to the plasma membrane (PM). Nevertheless, the rescued channels have an increased endocytosis rate, being quickly removed from the PM by the peripheral protein quality-control pathway. We previously reported that rescued Phe508del-CFTR (rPhe508del) can be retained at the cell surface by stimulating signaling pathways that coax the adaptor molecule ezrin (EZR) to tether rPhe508del-Na+/H+-exchange regulatory factor-1 complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby averting the rapid internalization of this channel variant. However, the molecular basis for why rPhe508del fails to recruit active EZR to the PM remains elusive. Here, using a proteomics approach, we characterized and compared the core components of wt-CFTR- or rPhe508del-containing macromolecular complexes at the surface of human bronchial epithelial cells. We identified calpain 1 (CAPN1) as an exclusive rPhe508del interactor that prevents active EZR recruitment, impairs rPhe508del anchoring to actin, and reduces its stability in the PM. We show that either CAPN1down-regulation or its chemical inhibition dramatically improves the functional rescue of Phe508del-CFTR in airway cells. These observations suggest that CAPN1 constitutes an appealing target for pharmacological intervention, as part of CF combination therapies restoring Phe508del-CFTR function.},

Pili were recently recognized in Streptococcus pneumoniae and implicated in the virulence of this bacterium, which led to the proposal of using these antigens in a future pneumococcal vaccine. However, pili were found to be encoded by the rlrA islet that was not universally distributed in the species. We examined the distribution of the pilus islet, using the presence of the rlrA gene as a marker for the locus, among a collection of invasive isolates recovered in Portugal and analyzed its association with capsular serotypes, clusters defined by the pulsed-field gel electrophoretic profiles (PFGE) and multilocus sequence types. Results. Only a minority of the isolates were positive for the presence of the rlrA gene (27%). There was a high correspondence between the serotype and the presence or absence of rlrA (Wallace coefficient, W = 0.778). In particular, there was an association between the presence of rlrA and the vaccine serotypes 4, 6B, 9V and 14 whereas the gene was significantly absent from other serotypes, namely 1, 7F, 8, 12B and 23F, a group that included a vaccine serotype (23F) and serotype 1 associated with enhanced invasiveness. Even within serotypes, there was variation in the presence of the pilus islet between PFGE clones and a higher Wallace coefficient (W = 0.939) indicates that carriage of the islet is a clonal property of pneumococci. Analysis of rlrA negative isolates revealed heterogeneity in the genomic region downstream of the rfl gene, the region where the islet is found in other isolates, compatible with recent loss of the islet in some lineages. Conclusion. The pilus islet is present in a minority of pneumococcal isolates recovered from human invasive infections and is therefore not an essential virulence factor in these infections. Carriage of the pilus islet is a clonal property of pneumococci that may vary between isolates expressing the same serotype and loss and acquisition of the islet may be ongoing. © 2008 Aguiar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

To evaluate the impact of PCV7 use, the serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of pneumococci causing invasive disease in Portugal during 2003-2005 were determined and compared with available data for the period 1999-2002. Changes in serotype distribution compatible with the introduction of PCV7 were shown for children ≤5 years of age from 2003 onwards and for adults from 2004 onwards. PCV7 use with coverage of 43% of children with four doses in the 2004 birth cohort, although substantially below universal coverage, seems to have contributed to greatly reducing the proportion of invasive infections due to vaccine serotypes 4, 6B, 14 and 23F. Similarly, significant indirect effects on the serotype distribution of pneumococci causing infections in adults were noted, with reductions in the proportion of invasive infections caused by serotypes 4, 5 and 14. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the proportion of two non-vaccine serotypes: 19A isolates in all age groups and 7F isolates in adults. Whereas serotypes 6B, 14 and 19A were associated with multidrug resistance, isolates expressing serotypes 4 and 7F were fully susceptible for the most part. There were no changes in the proportion of resistant isolates within each serotype and, in spite of the changes in serotype prevalence, there was not an overall reduction in the proportion of infections caused by resistant pneumococci. © 2008 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.},

   abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is able to form biofilms in vivo and previous studies propose that pneumococcal biofilms play a relevant role both in colonization and infection. Additionally, pneumococci recovered from human infections are characterized by a high prevalence of lysogenic bacteriophages (phages) residing quiescently in their host chromosome. We investigated a possible link between lysogeny and biofilm formation. Considering that extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a key factor in the biofilm matrix, we reasoned that prophage spontaneous activation with the consequent bacterial host lysis could provide a source of eDNA, enhancing pneumococcal biofilm development. Monitoring biofilm growth of lysogenic and non-lysogenic pneumococcal strains indicated that phage-infected bacteria are more proficient at forming biofilms, that is their biofilms are characterized by a higher biomass and cell viability. The presence of phage particles throughout the lysogenic strains biofilm development implicated prophage spontaneous induction in this effect. Analysis of lysogens deficient for phage lysin and the bacterial major autolysin revealed that the absence of either lytic activity impaired biofilm development and the addition of DNA restored the ability of mutant strains to form robust biofilms. These findings establish that limited phage-mediated host lysis of a fraction of the bacterial population, due to spontaneous phage induction, constitutes an important source of eDNA for the S. pneumoniae biofilm matrix and that this localized release of eDNA favors biofilm formation by the remaining bacterial population. © 2010 Carrolo et al.},

In contrast, emm4, emm75, and the ssa and speL/M genes were significantly associated with pharyngitis. There was a strong agreement between the emm type, the superantigen (SAg) genes and the clusters defined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling. Therefore, combinations of particular emm types and SAg genes frequently co-occurred in the same PFGE cluster, but there was no synergistic or antagonistic interaction between them in determining invasiveness. Only macrolide-susceptible PFGE clones were significantly associated with invasive infections or pharyngitis, while the clones of resistant isolates sharing all other molecular properties analyzed were equally prevalent in the two groups of isolates. Conclusions: This study confirmed the importance of the widely disseminated emm1-T1-ST28 clone in invasive infections but also identified other clones linked to either invasive infections (emm64-ST164) or pharyngitis (emm4-T4-ST39), which may be more limited in their temporal and geographical spread. Clonal properties like some emm types or SAg genes were associated with disease presentation, highlighting the importance of bacterial genetic factors to the outcome of GAS infections, although other, yet unidentified factors may also play an important role. © 2012 Friães et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {The profiling of the superantigen (SAg) encoding genes has been frequently used as a complementary typing method for group A streptococci (GAS), but a confusing gene nomenclature and a large diversity of primers used in screening has led to some conflicting results. The aim of this work was to develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method capable of efficiently amplifying all the known allelic variants of these genes, and to evaluate the congruence of this methodology with other commonly used molecular typing methods. The presence of the 11 known SAg genes and two other exotoxin-encoding genes (speB and speF) was tested in a collection of 480 clinical GAS isolates, using two multiplex PCR reactions. The SAg gene profile was compared with other typing methods. Four naturally occurring deletions involving the genes speB, speF, and rgg were characterized, two of which were found among invasive isolates. The absence of the chromosomally encoded genes speG and smeZ was supported by Southern blot hybridization and associated with specific GAS lineages, while the presence of phage-encoded genes was more variable. Positive associations between SAg genes or between SAg profiles and emm types or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) clusters were observed. The results suggest that the SAg profile diversifies faster than other properties commonly used for molecular typing, such as emm type and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence types (STs), and can be a useful complement in GAS molecular epidemiology. Still, the short-term stability of the SAg gene profile among prevalent genetic lineages may largely explain the observed associations between SAg genes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {Background: Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is used for rapid comparison of genomes of different bacterial strains. The purpose is to evaluate the distribution of genes from sequenced bacterial strains (control) among unsequenced strains (test). We previously compared the use of single strain versus multiple strain control with arrays covering multiple genomes. The conclusion was that a multiple strain control promoted a better separation of signals between present and absent genes. Findings. We now extend our previous study by applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit a mixture model to the signal distribution in order to classify each gene as present or absent and by comparing different methods for analyzing aCGH data, using combinations of different control strain choices, two different statistical mixture models, with or without normalization, with or without logarithm transformation and with test-over-control or inverse signal ratio calculation. We also assessed the impact of replication on classification accuracy. Higher values of accuracy have been achieved using the ratio of control-over-test intensities, without logarithmic transformation and with a strain mix control. Normalization and the type of mixture model fitted by the EM algorithm did not have a significant impact on classification accuracy. Similarly, using the average of replicate arrays to perform the classification does not significantly improve the results. Conclusions: Our work provides a guiding benchmark comparison of alternative methods to analyze aCGH results that can impact on the analysis of currently ongoing comparative genomic projects or in the re-analysis of published studies. © 2014 Cardoso et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

However, its functions in the context of vertebrate embryonic development have been largely unaddressed, in particular with a gene-specific focus. Here we show that the most abundant 3′UTR for the zebrafish fgf8a gene in the developing embryo mediates a strong translational repression, when compared to a more sparsely used alternative 3′UTR, which supports a higher translation efficiency. By inducing a shift in the selection efficiency of the associated polyadenylation sites, we show a temporally and spatially specific impact of fgf8a 3′UTR usage on embryogenesis, in particular at late stages during sensory system development. In addition, we identified a previously undescribed role for Fgf signalling in the initial stages of superficial retinal vascularization. These results reveal a critical functional importance of gene-specific alternative 3′UTRs in vertebrate embryonic development.},

Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a well characterized eukaryotic mRNA degradation pathway, responsible for the identification and degradation of transcripts harboring translation termination codons in premature contexts. Transcriptome-wide studies revealed that NMD is not only an mRNA surveillance pathway as initially thought, but is also a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of gene expression, as it fine-tunes the transcript levels of many wild-type genes. Hence, NMD contributes to the regulation of many essential biological processes, including pathophysiological mechanisms. In this chapter we discuss the importance of NMD and of its regulation to organism development and its link to the cellular stress responses, like the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the integrated stress response (ISR). Additionally, we describe how tumor cells have explored both NMD functions to promote tumorigenesis. Using published data and databases, we have also performed a network-based approach that further supports the link between NMD and these (patho) physiological processes.},

Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause the recessive genetic disease cystic fibrosis, where the chloride transport across the apical membrane of epithelial cells mediated by the CFTR protein is impaired. CFTR protein trafficking to the plasma membrane (PM) is the result of a complex interplay between the secretory and membrane recycling pathways that control the number of channels present at the membrane. In addition, the ion transport activity of CFTR at the PM is modulated through post-translational protein modifications. Previously we described that spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) phosphorylates a specific tyrosine residue in the nucleotide-binding domain 1 domain and this modification can regulate the PM abundance of CFTR. Here we identified the underlying biochemical mechanism using peptide pull-down assays followed by mass spectrometry. We identified in bronchial epithelial cells that the adaptor protein SHC1 recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated CFTR through its phosphotyrosine-binding domain and that the formation of a complex between SHC1 and CFTR is induced at the PM in the presence of activated SYK. The depletion of endogenous SHC1 expression was sufficient to promote an increase in CFTR at the PM of these cells. The results identify a SYK/SHC1 pathway that regulates the PM levels of CFTR channels, contributing to a better understanding of how CFTR-mediated chloride secretion is regulated.},

While essential for the life cycle of higher plants, the genetic basis underlying most of the process is not well understood. We previously used a combination of flow cytometry sorting of viable hydrated pollen grains and GeneChip array analysis of one-third of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome to define a first overview of the pollen transcriptome. We now extend that study to approximately 80% of the genome of Arabidopsis by using Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 arrays and perform comparative analysis of gene family and gene ontology representation in the transcriptome of pollen and vegetative tissues. Pollen grains have a smaller and overall unique transcriptome (6,587 genes expressed) with greater proportions of selectively expressed (11%) and enriched (26%) genes than any vegetative tissue. Relative gene ontology category representations in pollen and vegetative tissues reveal a functional skew of the pollen transcriptome toward signaling, vesicle transport, and the cytoskeleton, suggestive of a commitment to germination and tube growth. Cell cycle analysis reveals an accumulation of G2/M-associated factors that may play a role in the first mitotic division of the zygote. Despite the relative underrepresentation of transcription-associated transcripts, nonclassical MADS box genes emerge as a class with putative unique roles in pollen. The singularity of gene expression control in mature pollen grains is further highlighted by the apparent absence of small RNA pathway components. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

   abstract = {Background: Biological information is commonly used to cluster or classify entities of interest such as genes, conditions, species or samples. However, different sources of data can be used to classify the same set of entities and methods allowing the comparison of the performance of two data sources or the determination of how well a given classification agrees with another are frequently needed, especially in the absence of a universally accepted "gold standard" classification. Results: Here, we describe a novel measure - the Ranked Adjusted Rand (RAR) index. RAR differs from existing methods by evaluating the extent of agreement between any two groupings, taking into account the intercluster distances. This characteristic is relevant to evaluate cases of pairs of entities grouped in the same cluster by one method and separated by another. The latter method may assign them to close neighbour clusters or, on the contrary, to clusters that are far apart from each other. RAR is applicable even when intercluster distance information is absent for both or one of the groupings. In the first case, RAR is equal to its predecessor, Adjusted Rand (HA) index. Artificially designed clusterings were used to demonstrate situations in which only RAR was able to detect differences in the grouping patterns. A study with larger simulated clusterings ensured that in realistic conditions, RAR is effectively integrating distance and partition information. The new method was applied to biological examples to compare 1) two microbial typing methods, 2) two gene regulatory network distances and 3) microarray gene expression data with pathway information. In the first application, one of the methods does not provide intercluster distances while the other originated a hierarchical clustering. RAR proved to be more sensitive than HA in the choice of a threshold for defining clusters in the hierarchical method that maximizes agreement between the results of both methods. Conclusion: RAR has its major advantage in combining cluster distance and partition information, while the previously available methods used only the latter. RAR should be used in the research problems were HA was previously used, because in the absence of inter cluster distance effects it is an equally effective measure, and in the presence of distance effects it is a more complete one. © 2007 Pinto et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: Microarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) evaluates the distribution of genes of sequenced bacterial strains among unsequenced strains of the same or related species. As genomic sequences from multiple strains of the same species become available, multistrain microarrays are designed, containing spots for every unique gene in all sequenced strains. To perform two-color aCGH experiments with multistrain microarrays, the choice of control sample can be the genomic DNA of one strain or a mixture of all the strains used in the array design. This important problem has no universally accepted solution. Results: We performed a comparative study of the two control sample options with a Streptococcus pneumoniae microarray designed with three fully sequenced strains. We separately hybridized two of these strains (R6 and G54) as test samples using the third strain alone (TIGR4) or a mixture of the three strains as control. We show that for both types of control it is advantageous to analyze spots in separate sets according to their expected control channel signal (5-15% AUC increase). Following this analysis, the use of a mix control leads to higher accuracies (5% increase). This enhanced performance is due to gains in sensitivity (21% increase, p = 0.001) that compensate minor losses in specificity (5% decrease, p = 0.014). Conclusion: The use of a single strain control increases the error rate in genes that are part of the accessory genome, where more variation across unsequenced strains is expected, further justifying the use of the mix control. © 2008 Pinto et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The characterization of group.A streptococci recovered during 2004-2006, which is reported here, revealed that resistance was not stable during this period and that the decline in erythromycin resistance observed during 2004-2006 was due to a decrease in the prevalence of isolates presenting the M phenotype, while the proportion of isolates expressing the MLS B phenotype remained stable. Characterization by emm typing, T serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling and multilocus sequence typing revealed a very diverse population. Several of the major PFGE clusters identified had already been found in the 1998-2003 study period, but others were found for the first time, e.g. T11/emm 11/ST403, carrying the erm (B) gene, and T3/13/emm 3/ST315, carrying the mef (A) gene. The clone defined as T12/emm 12/ST36, previously found to be associated with mef (A), was now found to be predominantly associated with erm (B).

   abstract = {Background. The boundaries of bacterial species and the mechanisms underlying bacterial speciation are matters of intense debate. Theoretical studies have shown that recombination acts as a strong cohesive force preventing divergence in bacterial populations. Streptococcus pneumoniae populations have the telltale signs of high recombination with competence implicated as the major driving force behind gene exchange. Competence in S. pneumoniae is triggered by a quorum-sensing mechanism controlled by the competence-stimulating peptide pheromone. Results. We studied the distribution of the two major pherotypes in the pneumococcal population and their association with serotype, antimicrobial resistance and genetic lineage. Using multilocus sequence data we evaluated pherotype influence on the dynamics of horizontal gene transfer. We show that pherotype is a clonal property of pneumococci. Standard population genetic analysis and multilocus infinite allele model simulations support the hypothesis that two genetically differentiated populations are defined by the major pherotypes. Conclusion. Severe limitations to gene flow can therefore occur in bacterial species in the absence of geographical barriers and within highly recombinogenic populations. This departure from panmixia can have important consequences for our understanding of the response of pneumococci to human imposed selective pressures such as vaccination and antibiotic use. © 2009 Carrolo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

DGs form modules in protein interaction networks and diseases with common phenotypes share more DGs or have more closely interacting DGs.

S2B prioritizes genes frequently and specifically present in shortest paths linking two disease modules. Top S2B scores identified genes in the overlap of artificial network modules more than 80% of the times, even with incomplete or noisy knowledge. Applied to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Spinal Muscular Atrophy, S2B candidates were enriched in biological processes previously associated with motor neuron degeneration. Some S2B candidates closely interacted in network cliques, suggesting common molecular mechanisms for the two diseases. S2B is a valuable tool for DG prediction, bringing new insights into pathological mechanisms.

   abstract = {In Streptococcus pneumoniae the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), encoded by the comC gene, controls competence development and influences biofilm growth. We explored the influence of pherotype, defined by the two major comC allelic variants (comC1 and comC2), on biofilm development and recombination efficiency. Among isolates recovered from human infections those presenting comC1 show a higher capacity to form in vitro biofilms. The influence of pherotype on biofilm growth was confirmed by experiments with isogenic strains differing in their comC alleles. Biofilm architecture evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that strains carrying comC1 form biofilms that are denser and thicker than those carrying the comC2 allele. Isogenic strains carrying the comC1 allele yielded more transformants than those carrying the comC2 allele in both planktonic and biofilm growth. Transformation assays with comC knockout strains show that ComD1 needs lower doses of the signaling peptide to reach the same biological outcomes. In contrast to mixed planktonic growth, within mixed biofilms inter-pherotype genetic exchange is less frequent than that occurring between bacteria of the same pherotype. Since biofilms are a major bacterial lifestyle, these observations may explain the genetic differentiation between populations with different pherotypes reported previously. Considering that biofilms have been associated with colonization our results suggest that strains carrying the comC1 allele may be more transmissible and more efficient at persisting in carriage. Both effects may help explain the higher prevalence of the comC1 allele in the pneumococcal population. © 2014 Carrolo et al.},

Different diseases can have common deregulated molecular pathways, particularly if they partially share phenotypes. These commonalities are frequently represented as an overlap of disease-related cellular subnetworks. The discovery of the overlaps and thus genes simultaneously associated with multiple diseases can shed light on the molecular pathomechanisms and provide new polyvalent therapeutic targets. This work builds upon a previously developed double specific-betweenness (S2B) network-based method, to prioritize proteins with a higher probability of being simultaneously associated with two phenotypically similar diseases. This method was designed to use undirected networks of protein physical interactions. The present work aims to expand the S2B method, enabling the analysis of networks with directed interactions, such as signaling and transcriptional regulatory cellular networks, providing new regulatory information and contributing to richer mechanistic hypothesis to explain the common physiological deficiencies. The new extended version of the method was tested with artificial disease modules, which enabled to test the S2B method ability to predict the overlap between the disease-related subnetworks. As in the undirected version of S2B, this novel version was applied to a pair of motor neuron diseases - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) -demonstrating once again its potential to bring new insights into the common pathological mechanisms and particularly, its ability to retrieve novel disease genes associated with the disturbance of regulatory mechanisms involved in motor neuron degeneration.},

The lung epithelium is lined with a layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) that is crucial for healthy lung function. ASL thickness is controlled by two ion channels: epithelium sodium channel (ENaC) and cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Here, we present a minimal mathematical model of ENaC, CFTR and ASL regulation that sheds light on the control of ENaC by the short palate lung and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) protein and by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). The model, despite its simplicity, yields a good fit to experimental observations and is an effective tool for exploring the interplay between ENaC, CFTR and ASL. Steady-state data and dynamic information constrain the model’s parameters without ambiguities. Testing the hypothesis that PI(4,5)P2 protects ENaC from ubiquitination suggests that this protection does not improve the model results and that the control of the ENaC opening probability by PI(4,5)P2 is sufficient to explain all available data. The model analysis further demonstrates that ASL at the steady state is sensitive to small changes in PI(4,5)P2 abundance, particularly in CF conditions, which suggests that manipulation of phosphoinositide metabolism may promote therapeutic benefits for CF patients.},

   abstract = {Very diverse research fields frequently deal with the analysis of multiple clustering results, which should imply an objective detection of overlaps and divergences between the formed groupings. The congruence between these multiple results can be quantified by clustering comparison measures such as the Wallace coefficient (W). Since the measured congruence is dependent on the particular sample taken from the population, there is variability in the estimated values relatively to those of the true population. In the present work we propose the use of a confidence interval (CI) to account for this variability when W is used. The CI analytical formula is derived assuming a Gaussian sampling distribution and recurring to the algebraic relationship between W and the Simpson's index of diversity. This relationship also allows the estimation of the expected Wallace value under the assumption of independence of classifications. We evaluated the CI performance using simulated and published microbial typing data sets. The simulations showed that the CI has the desired 95% coverage when the W is greater than 0.5. This behaviour is robust to changes in cluster number, cluster size distributions and sample size. The analysis of the published data sets demonstrated the usefulness of the new CI by objectively validating some of the previous interpretations, while showing that other conclusions lacked statistical support. © 2008 Pinto et al.},

   abstract = {c 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics For participating in the SemEval 2013 challenge of recognition and classification of drug names, we adapted our chemical entity recognition approach consisting in Conditional Random Fields for recognizing chemical terms and lexical similarity for entity resolution to the ChEBI ontology. We obtained promising results, with a best F-measure of 0.81 for the partial matching task when using post-processing. Using only Conditional Random Fields the results are slightly lower, achieving still a good result in terms of F-measure. Using the ChEBI ontology allowed a significant improvement in precision (best precision of 0.93 in partial matching task), which indicates that taking advantage of an ontology can be extremely useful for enhancing chemical entity recognition.},
